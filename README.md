# EconstorCorpus

[Econstor](https://www.econstor.eu/) is [ZBW](http://www.zbw.eu/)'s [Open access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access) server for scientific publications.
In this repository you can find [iPython notebooks](http://ipython.org/notebook.html):
  1. Providing a `Luke_the_Downloader` downloads PDF files (publications) from Econstor along with some meta data.
  2. `Han_the_Converter` extracts the plaintext from those files, which is required to do text mining.

More information are provided in the notebooks.
