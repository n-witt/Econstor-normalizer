Pilat and Lee 2001, for example, show that to capture the benefits of Information and Communication Technologies ICT it is not necessary to dispose of an ICT producing sector. Timely diffusionof new technology or, from the firms point of view, its adoption is a key element to securingeconomic growth. It is thus not surprising that technology policy stresses the importance of thefirms capacity to absorb and successfully apply technological knowledge. From this perspective,understanding the factors determining technology adoption becomes highly relevant also fromthe policy point of view.This paper investigates the adoption of ICT in the Swiss business sector based on data collectedin a survey we conducted in autumn 2000. We dispose of firmspecific information on ICT usee.g. time period of adoption of nine technology elements, share of employees using specifictechnologies, range of application of Internet and Intranet respectively, objectives of and obstacles to the adoption of ICT, etc  Moreover, we got information referring to various structuralcharacteristics of the firm size, industry affiliation, human resources, etc. as well as a largenumber of variables pertaining to workplace organisation which may potentially serve as determinants of the adoption decision.The aim of the paper is to explain the timing and intensity of the adoption of ICT well as of certain elements of this bundle of technologies such as Internet, Ecommerce, etc  The investigationis primarily based on a rank model of technology diffusion, which, in explaining interfirmdifferences of adoption time and intensity, emphasises differences among firms with respect tothe profitability potential of technology adoption arising from the heterogeneity of firms. In addition, we take into account information spillovers from users to nonusers which are the mainelement of the epidemic model of technology diffusion; see Karshenas and Stoneman 1995 or Geroski 2000 for a survey of diffusion models.In this study we apply a slightly modified version of a model of adoption we used in earlier workdealing with the introduction of Advanced Manufacturing Technologies Arvanitis and Hollenstein, 2001. Its main characteristic is a more comprehensive modelling of rank effects than itis the case in most other empirical models. In explaining technology adoption we consider anumber of factors which gained attention only recently in empirical work. Firstly, anticipatedprofitability, the core factor determining adoption, is specified by taking account of many dimensions of benefits from as well as costs of adoption for a similar approach see Baldwin and Rafiquzzaman, 1998. To this end we use information on the relevance of specific objectives of andobstacles to the adoption of ICT as assessed by the firms themselves. In this way, we take account of information and adjustment costs which, according to the survey of Karshenas and Stoneman 1995, have been neglected in most analyses as well as of anticipated benefits andrelated uncertainties as perceived by the firms. Secondly, in order to clarify the role of firm size,a variable used in almost every study of technology adoption, we proceed in two ways: on the 2 one hand, we use firm size as an independent explanatory factor in this case it covers sizespecific variables not explicitly modelled such as, for example, economies of scope; on the otherhand, we take account of the interaction of firm size with other explanatory variables sizedependence of the model; the latter is explored by estimating the adoption model separately forsmall and large firms to see whether the driving forces behind adoption differ between the twosize classes. Thirdly, we explore the role of workplace organisation in determining the adoptionof ICT which seems to have a positive impact on productivity, not only directly see e.g. Ichniovski et al., 1997; Murphy, 2002 but also indirectly through an increase of the propensity to adopt ICT conceptualised as a complementary factor see e.g. Breshnahan et al, 2002. Finally, we estimate the postulated model with several types of adoption measures as dependent variables e.g.time period and intensity of the adoption of specific elements of ICT, intensity of ICT use in general in order to separate robust from shaky relationships and to identify differences in the patternof explanation for the various types of adoption variables. We expect, for example, that the firstuse of Internet a basic element of ICT with a broad range of application is driven by somewhatdifferent forces than the introduction of Ecommerce whose profitability potential varies acrossfirms and industries to a larger extent see e.g. OECD, 2000.The broadly defined concept of profitability allows to identify bottlenecks of the diffusion process such as, for example, ICTrelated manpower deficiencies, which may be addressed by policymeasures. Moreover, information deficiencies or lack of finance may be a problem for smallfirms but not for large ones; therefore, sizespecific model estimates may show whether policy, ifnecessary at all, needs to be differentiated by firm size.The setup of the paper is as follows: Section 2 gives for the Swiss business sector a brief description of the diffusion profile of the elements of ICT considered in this paper. The theoreticalbackground of the analysis and the specification of the empirical model are presented in Section 3 and 4 respectively, followed by some information on data and method Section 5. The empirical estimates are found in Section 6. Finally, we summarise and assess the main findings, indicate some directions for future research and draw some policy conclusions.2. DIFFUSION OF ICT IN THE SWISS BUSINESS SECTORTable 1 contains some information on the time path of adoption of nine elements of ICT in the Swiss business sector. The diffusion rate in 2003 percentage of firms using a certain technologyin the year 2000 or planning to use it till 2003 and diffusion velocity increase of the percentageof firms using a certain ICT element in the period 19942003 varies quite strongly among thesetechnologies.For example, the degree of diffusion of PCs being already an old technology was quite high in 1994 and increased since then compared to other ICT elements, only by 55%. On the otherhand, new technologies, in particular Internet and related technologies Email, Intranet, Extranet, were used by a very small fraction of firms in the midnineties, but this share exploded inthe second half of the last decade. The growth of the diffusion rate, as planned by the surveyed 3 firms for the period 20002003, will slow down for most ICT elements primarily reflecting thehigh level of diffusion already reached in 2000. In the years to come, diffusion will thus primarily take place within rather than across firms.A characterisation of the various technology elements according to the criteria diffusion rateand velocity of diffusion leads to the following mapping: technologies with high diffusionrates are PCs with low velocity as well as Email and Internet very high velocity; ICT elements with a medium diffusion rate are LANWAN, EDI, Laptop and to some extent also Digital Assistants high velocity, particularly EDI, and, finally, technologies with a low diffusion rateare Intranet and Extranet very high velocity.These tendencies vary by firm size, strongly in case of network technologies EDI, LANWAN,Intranet, Extranet, not very pronounced for other ICT elements. There are also differencesamong industrial sectors with modern service industries business services, RDIT firms,bankinginsurance and hightech manufacturing taking the lead; lowtech manufacturing andtraditional services are in a medium position whereas the construction sector is clearly laggingin this respect. Compared to other countries, diffusion of ICT in Switzerland business sector ishigh: It ranks behind the USA and Scandinavia, but together with the Netherlands is clearlyahead of other European countries see Arvanitis and Hollenstein, 2002, based on varioussources such as OECD, 2001.3. THEORETICAL BACKGROUNDThe main objective of this section is to formulate an equation explaining the decision to adopt ICT based on a set of mainly firmspecific factors determining the profitability of new technology. Within the general conceptual framework proposed by Karshenas and Stoneman 1995 ourapproach belongs rather to the category of rank models emphasising the heterogeneity of firmsas determinant of interfirm diffusion patterns, although we also take into account, to some extent, epidemic effects. In the rank model, it is assumed that potential users of a new technologydiffer from each other in important dimensions so that some firms obtain a greater return fromnew technology than others do. The larger the net advantage resulting from the technology adoption, the stronger the tendency to adopt early and intensively.We distinguish several groups of factors which potentially influence positively or negatively afirms profitability from adopting new technology and therefore the decision to introduce it at acertain time. A first one includes a set of anticipated benefits of new technology such as savingsof inputs, general efficiency gains, higher flexibility, improvement of product quality, etc., invarious ways see e.g. Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 2000; OECD, 2000; Lucking et al., 2001: ICT mayreduce capital needs through, for example, lower inventory requirements, or it may save labour ingeneral or substitute for specific labour skills e.g. sales staff, lowskill workers. It may increasethe efficient use of inputs in general making use of the increased scope for flexible and decentralised work organisation. Moreover, it may lead to higher product quality at large in variousways e.g. increased product variety and convenience, supply of complementary services. To 4 mention is also the potential of reducing transaction costs, for example, by improving relationships to suppliers of material, components, capital and labour, as well as the consumerorientation. For this group of variables we expect a positive influence on the adoption decision,i.e. early andor intensive use of the new technology is favoured.A second category of variables, which are negatively related to adoption, refers to anticipatedbarriers to the adoption of new technology. We identify five main types of such hindrances: unfavourable financial conditions e.g. liquidity constraints, large investment requirements, etc.;human capital restrictions e.g. lack of ICT specialists, multiskilled workers; information andknowledge barriers reflecting, for example, uncertainties with respect to the performance or thefuture development of ICT; organisational and managerial barriers e.g. resistance to new technology within the firm; insufficient awareness of managers of the potential gains of ICT and,finally, sunk cost barriers which refer to the substitution costs firms have to incur in order to introduce the new technology, for example, in case of insufficient compatibility of ICT with existing equipment or organisation.1The firms ability to absorb knowledge from external sources and exploit them for its own innovative activities is another major determinant of innovation performance in general and of technology adoption in particular. There are mainly two aspects of a firms absorptive capacity fornew technologies: firstly, the firms overall ability to assess technological opportunities in oraround its fields of activity in terms of products and production techniques which depends primarily of the endowment with human and knowledge capital Cohen and Levinthal, 1989; secondly, learning effects that may arise from earlier use of ICT or a predecessor of a specific ICTelement which embodies constituent elements of later applied, more advanced vintage; evidencefor the importance of learning effects is presented, for example, by Colombo and Mosconi1995, Mc Williams and Zilberman 1996 or Arvanitis and Hollenstein 2001. Both elementsof absorptive capacity should be positively related to early and intensive use of ICT.Whereas these aspects of absorptive capacity are specifically related to internal conditions, thestandard epidemic model of technology diffusion stresses information spillovers from users tononusers external learning in a more general way; various brands of this approach are discussed, for example, in Geroski 2000. The epidemic model basically states that a firms propensity to adopt a technology at a certain point in time is positively influenced by the present orlagged degree of its diffusion in the economy as a whole or by the proportion of adopters in theindustry or sector to which the specific firm belongs to.Firm size and firm age are two explanatory variables which are used in most studies of adoptionbehaviour see Karshenas and Stoneman, 1995. In this investigation, we only include firm size,since the theoretical arguments with respect to the role of firm age are not conclusive: positiveimpact on adoption in case of older firms reflecting specific technological experience vs. a 1 See e.g. Cainarca et al. 1990 or Link and Kapur 1994 for a treatment of these aspects based on the case offlexible manufacturing systems, or the results of a survey on obstacles to the adoption of Ecommerce WITSA,2000. 5 negative effect for this category of firms due to lower adjustment costs in younger companieswith a more uptodate capital stock see Dunne, 1994.2 As already mentioned, the role of firmsize, which is expected to be positively related to adoption, is studied in some detail in this paper.Firm size plays a special role: one the one hand, it may prove to be an independent additionaldeterminant of adoption, in which case it stands for firmspecific effects not explicitly modelledcapacity to absorb risks related to future ICT developments, economies of scale in Ecommerce,access to capital markets, etc.; on the other hand, it may function as a proxy for variables of themodel when it is strongly correlated with them sizedependence of the model. We shall accountfor both of these aspects at different stages of the empirical analysis.The adoption of ICT may also be affected by product market conditions under which firms areoperating, particularly the competitive pressure they are exposed to. In those markets wherecompetition is fiercer, demand elasticities can be expected to be higher because of the existenceof close substitutes, thus driving firms to innovative activity or rapid technology adoption seee.g. Majumdar and Venkataraman, 1993.3 In case of small open economies like Switzerlandinternational competition is a particularly effective way of forcing firms to adopt the most efficient way of producing or to temporarily evade competitive pressure through innovative products; for empirical evidence, see Bertschek 1995 and, specifically for ICT i.e. Eselling,Bertschek and Fryges 2002.In large parts of theoretical literature, market concentration is taken to reflect competitive pressure. Gametheoretic models e.g. Reinganum 1981 show that the impact of market structureupon the schedule of adoption dates depends critically on the difference of profit rates precedingand following adoption. However, this type of models does not come up with unambiguous results see the review of Reinganum, 1989, and the empirical evidence is very mixed see Karshenas and Stoneman, 1995. In addition, in case of a small open economy the usual measures of concentration referring to the home market are not very helpful. Therefore, rather thanexplicitly including market structure as a determinant of ICT adoption, we assume that it is captured by industry dummies.Industry dummies are also used to represent two other factors influencing adoption time and intensity: on the demand side, favourable market prospects may exert a positive impact on theadoption of new technology because it enhances the financial room of manoeuvre of the firm; onthe supply side, technological opportunities determining extent and limits of the use of ICTmight vary quite strongly across industries although there certainly are also some firmspecificdifferences in this respect. The theoretical arguments put forward so far will serve to specify thebasic model of the empirical analysis. 2 In addition, since firm size and firm age are negatively correlated, it is difficult to get reliable empirical results.3 In accordance to this line of reasoning, we have proxied in an earlier study on the determinants of innovativeactivity competitive pressure through the intensity of price and nonprice competition on the product market andpostulated a positive relationship to innovative activity see Arvanitis and Hollenstein, 1994. We applied thesame argument in an analysis of the adoption of Advanced Manufacturing Technologies Arvanitis and Hollenstein, 2001. 6 The last decade saw an impressive increase of adoption not only of ICT but also of new workpractices. It is thus not surprising that the investigation of the impact of the two factors on variables such as efficiency and productivity, labour and skill demand, etc. has become a prominentfield of research. One type of studies tried to establish a direct link between organisationalchange and productivity growth see e.g. Ichniovski et al., 1997; Black and Lynch, 2000. Similarly, there has been much research devoted to the analysis of the direct relationship of ICT andproductivity, particularly at the macro or mesolevel among many others, see e.g. Jorgensonand Stiroh, 2000; Jorgenson, 2001; Colecchia and Schreyer, 2001; examples at the microlevelare Lichtenberg 1995, Brynjolfsson and Hitt 1995 or Greenan and Mairesse 1996. Somerecent studies stressed the complementarity of the adoption of new models of workplace organisation and the introduction or a more intensive use of ICT. In this view, investments in ICT aremore productive if accompanied by suitable organisational innovations, and the productivity ofadjustments of workplace organisation is higher if it is supported by investments in ICT see e.g.Breshnahan et al., 2002; Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 2000; Bertschek and Kaiser, 2001; Mc Kinsey,2001.4 Against this background, we formulate an extended model of ICT adoption which complements the basic approach by variables representing the change of workplace organisation.4. EMPIRICAL MODEL4.1 Adoption Variable The database see Section 5 allows to construct various adoption variables; a first category ofmeasures refers to the time period of adoption of ICT, a second one to the intensity of use of ICTat a given point in time.We dispose of information on five time periods of adoption for the nine ICT elements listed in Table 1. In addition, there is information on the actual and planned use of the Internet for variousobjectives Esales, Eprocurement, etc  We shall present results for two variables see Table 2.The first one refers to the adoption of Internet INTERNET which is specified as a variable withfive response levels ranging from value 4 for the earliest adoption period up to 1994 to value 0for firms not even planning adoption up to 2003.5 The second variable represents the adoption of Internetbased selling ESALES; it has three response levels with value 2 representing adoptionin the time period up to the year 2000, value 1 for 20012003 planned use and zero for no usetill 2003.To construct a variable for adoption intensity, we used information on the withinfirm diffusionof certain technologies PCs, Internet, Intranet as well as on the diffusion rate of the variouselements of ICT. We present again results for two variables see Table 2. Firstly, we calculated afour level ordinal measure of the overall ICT intensity ICTINT, defined as the number of ICT 4 An open question is whether complementarity is contemporaneous, or whether one of the two factors is lagging.Breshnahan et al. 2002, for example, assumes that workplace organisation is fixed in the short run whereas theuse of ICT can be adjusted quite quickly.5 Estimates with an alternative number of response levels, e.g. three or four responses, yielded very similar results. 7 elements as listed in Table 16 already in use in the year 2000: intensity level 3 in case of 7 to 9ICT elements, level 2 for 56 technologies, level 1 for 3 to 4 items and level 0 if less technologies0 included have been introduced. The second intensity variable refers to the intensity of use of Internet measured by the proportion of employees regularly working with this technology in theyear 2000; this variable NETUSE is also measured on an ordinal scale since the surveyed firmsreported estimates on the share of Internet workers based on five categories up to 20%, 2140%,4160%, 6180%, 81100% of employment. Adding the nonusers we get an ordinal variablewith six response levels.4.2 Determinants of ICT Adoption Table 3a,b gives an overview on the empirical specification of the variables which reflect thevarious groups of factors determining technology adoption as set out in Section 3. The first set ofvariables refers to the objectives of ICT adoption which are interpreted as proxies for anticipatedrevenue increases benefits due to the use of new technology. This interpretation can be justifiedon ground of evidence on the impact of the use of ICT on the firms efficiency based on theirassessments measured on a fivepoint Likert scale with a value range of highly negative contribution to efficiency value 2 up to strong increase of efficiency value 2. Not less than 61%of the surveyed firms report positive effects, whereas only 1% see a negative impact of ICTadoption on overall efficiency. The three metric variables listed in Table 3a under the headingobjectives are factor scores resulting from a principal component factor analysis of 13 objectives of the use of ICT included in the questionnaire for details on the factor solution see Table A.1 in the Appendix.7 The first factor MARKET is related to anticipated benefits on the revenue side; in addition to higher sales in general, ICT is expected to yield benefits from higherquality, more variety, the supply of complementary services, stronger presence at the market andstronger customerorientation. The second factor COST is related to cost reduction in generaland, more specifically, to advantages to be gained from improving internal communication anddecisionmaking as well as optimising production processes. This factor is, to some extent, relatedto workplace organisation, which is treated separately in the extended version of the model. Thethird factor INPUT covers anticipated advantages from improving external relationships on theinput side labour market, cooperation with suppliers as well as with respect to technology. Forthese three variables, which cover to a large extent the benefits expected from the use of ICT asproposed by literature see Section 3, we expect to find a positive influence on the adoptionvariables. 6 We decided to rescale the count data information 0 up to 9 technologies into ordered categories ordinal variables because of the nonequivalence of the elements not each additional ICT element is of the same importance: e.g. PC vs. Extranet. Although this problem of nonequivalence cannot be definitely solved it is muchweakened by reducing the 9 counts to 4 ordinal groups.7 The main characteristics of the factor solution are quite independent from the procedures used for factor extraction principal component vs. maximum likelihood and rotation varimax vs. equamax. The final factor solutionas presented in Table A.1 accounts for 58% of total variance which is quite satisfactory. 8 Secondly, the model covers all five categories of obstacles to the adoption of ICT we identifiedin Section 3 see Table 3a. They should lead to late and less intensive adoption negative sign.A first variable NOUSE captures the fact that in some instances there is hardly a real potential for using ICT. The other four variables reflecting impediments to the use of ICT are againthe result of a principal component factor analysis for details of the fourfactor solution, whichis based on the firms assessment of the relevance of 12 obstacles to adoption and explains 65%of the variance, see Table A.2 in the Appendix. The four metric variables, with the exception ofthe factor standing for problems of financing ICT investments INVCOST, can be interpreted,primarily, as proxies for uncertainties, information problems and adjustment costs related to theintroduction of ICT variables KNOWHOW, TECH, COMPAT. They thus capture determinantsof adoption which are neglected in most studies treating this topic see Karshenas and Stoneman,1995.The firms ability to absorb knowledge from external sources, which we expect to be positivelyrelated to early and intensive adoption, is captured by three variables measuring the availabilityof human and knowledge capital see Table 3a: EDUC, the share of employees with qualifications at the tertiary level, is a general measure of the firms ability to assess technological opportunities and to use external knowledge for own innovative activities. INNOPD, a dichotomous measure indicating whether a firm launched product innovations in a three years referenceperiod 19982000, is used to take into account the finding of Cohen and Levinthal 1979 according to which internal innovative activity is a precondition for successfully using externalknowledge. The third variable we employ to capture absorptive capacity is more directly linkedwith ICT: we use the share of employees which, in a reference year 1999, attended ICToriented training courses TRAINING as a proxy for the firms specific knowledge in ICT; sinceknowledge required to mastering ICT is rapidly changing, a variable reflecting investment in ICTspecific training is probably a suitable measure.8 Since some training is necessary when ICTis introduced, this variable is not strictly exogenous reflecting the already mentioned complementarity hypothesis of Breshnahan et al. 2002.It is not easy to find suitable proxies for measuring learning from previous vintages of ICT in acrosssection framework. Variables which measure learning in the field of ICT in general, suchas, for example, the intensity of use of PCs at an early stage, are problematic since they are determined by similar factors as measures reflecting ICT intensity at a later stage. Therefore, weexplored the role of learning only in one specific case where an earlier and a later vintage oftechnology are clearly linked: we hypothesise that experience with electronic data interchangeEDI, measured by the dummy variable EDI97 adoption of EDI in 1997 or in earlier years,favours adoption of Eselling although adjustment costs incurred by the substitution of Internetbased selling for the use of EDI work in the opposite direction. External learning through information spillovers epidemic effects is represented by the ICT diffusion rate at industry 8 We do not dispose of information with respect to the share of high or mediumskilled workers with a degree orcertificate in the field of ICT. 9 level; the percentage share of firms which are, in the year 1997, more ICTintensive than the averagefirm of the industry the company belongs to EPIDINT is used in explaining the time period of adoption of Internet and the two variables measuring ICT intensity in the year 2000lagged epidemic effect. In case of Eselling, where, in our dataset, the first adoption period refers to 19982000, epidemic effects are proxied by the industryspecific diffusion rate in 2000EPIDSALE; contemporaneous effect.Firm size S is measured by dummy variables related to five size classes based on the number ofemployees with large firms 500 and more employees as reference group. In this specification, anegative sign stands for positive size effects. An alternative specification of firm size based onthe number of employees and its square yielded very similar results.International competition on the product market as an incentive to engage in ICT is proxied bythe firms export propensity, i.e. the sales share of exported goods and services. We use a specification with a linear as well as a quadratic term variables X, X2 assuming that the export shareis positively related to the adoption rate up to a certain level beyond which no further impact is tobe expected.9As a last element of the basic version of our empirical model, we include 15 industry dummiessee Table 3a which should capture differences with respect to technological opportunitiesmore scope for ICT in knowledgebased industries, demand prospects e.g. high growth rates insome service industries, market structure and other not explicitly specified factors determining afirms propensity to adopt ICT.The extended model includes as additional variables various elements of workplace organisationas well as some measures of organisational change related to the period 19952000 see Table 3b. Firstly, we take into account three types of new work practices, i.e. teamworking TEAM,job rotation ROTATE and multiskilling MSKILL. The first two variables measure the diffusion within the firm of teamworking and job rotation respectively on an sixpoint ordinal scalevery common practice to does not exist. MSKILL represents the degree of diversity oftasks an average worker performs 5point scale; very high to very low. We expect thatthe existence of these work practices are a favourable environment for early and intensive adoption of ICT. Similarly, a high degree of workers participation in decisionmaking is assumed toimpact positively on the adoption of ICT. To get a measure of the role of workers in decisionmaking, we conducted a principal component factor analysis of 7 dimensions of work for whichthe surveyed firms assessed the balance of decisionmaking power between managers and workers5point scale ranging from manager decides alone up to decision is the sole responsibility ofthe worker. This analysis for details see Table A.3 in the Appendix yielded two factors, thefirst one variable PRODDEC pertaining to dimensions of work which are related to the production process design of work process, distribution of tasks among workers, etc., the second 9 In earlier work, we used the number of principal competitors at world scale as a measure of international competition see e.g. Arvanitis and Hollenstein, 1994, 2001; this information, however, is not available in the datasetused in this study. 10 one USERDEC primarily related to customeroriented tasks regular contact with customers,contact with clients in case of complaints. Two additional variables reflect the process of decentralising decisionmaking power within a firm during the second half of the nineties:DELCOMP gives information whether there has been an increase of delegation of decisionmaking power towards the workers yesno, FLAT stands for a flattening of the hierarchical structureyesno; both variables are expected to favour adoption of ICT. Alternatively, using a procedureproposed by Breshnahan et al. 2002, we constructed a compound measure of new workplaceorganisation ORG by addingup the standardised values of TEAM, ROTATION, MSKILL,PRODDEC, USERDEC, DELCOMP and FLAT.5. DATA AND METHODThe analysis is based on firm data of the Swiss business sector collected in a survey we conducted in autumn 2000. The available information is to a large extent qualitative in naturenominal or ordinal measures. The questionnaire yielded data on the time profile of the introduction of nine ICT elements, the intensity of use of ICT, the assessment of a number of objectives pursued by introducing ICT and the importance of factors impeding its application, the specific use of ICT elements such as Internet or Intranet and the impact of ICT on efficiency andlabour requirements. Besides we got information on the adoption of new work practices teamworking, job rotation, distribution of decisionmaking power at the workplace, etc. and trainingactivities, which presumably are relevant when a firm decides on the adoption of ICT. Finally,we dispose of information about structural characteristics of firms such as size, industry affiliation, propensity to export, human capital endowment, etc. which may also serve as determinantsof ICT adoption.The questionnaire.10 has been addressed to a sample of 6717 firms with five or more employees,which covered the business sector of the economy see Table A.6 in the Appendix. The samplehas been disproportionally stratified by 28 industries and three industryspecific firm sizeclasses with full coverage of large firms. The response rate of about 40% 2641 firms is quitesatisfactory in view of the very demanding questionnaire. To correct for unit nonresponse, weconducted a nonresponse analysis with 650 firms response rate 94%. We found some selectivity bias which has been corrected by a suitable weighting scheme for the method used, see Donze, 1998. The structure of the dataset in terms of firm size and industry is, with a few exceptions, very similar to that of the underlying sample see Table A.6.Item nonresponse is another problem of survey data. The usual procedure of dropping observations with incomplete data may produce biased estimates of means, proportions and regressioncoefficients. To solve this problem, we used the multiple imputation procedure see Rubin,1987; the details of this method as applied in the present case, as well as its robustness aredocumented and discussed in Donze 1998. By substituting imputed values for missing ones wecould avoid a loss of observations. 10 The questionnaire can be downloaded from www.kof.gess.ethz.ch. 11 Since the dependent variables of the adoption model are measured on an ordinal scale three tosix ordinally scaled response levels, the ordered probit procedure is an appropriate method forestimating the adoption equations.6. EMPIRICAL RESULTS6.1 Time Period and Intensity of ICT Adoption Time period of ICT adoption The estimation results for the time period of adoption of two elements of ICT, i.e. Internet variable INTERNET and Internetbased selling ESALES, using the basic model are presented in Table 4. As can be seen from the results for specification 1 columns 1 and 5 respectively, withone exception export propensity in case of ESALES, all categories of explanatory variablesdistinguished in Section 5, though not to the same extent, have a statistically significant impact.The overall fit of the model is satisfactory. The core of our adoption model is thus confirmed.More specifically, we conclude that a multidimensional modelling of anticipated benefits andcosts of ICT adoption, a specific feature of our approach, does pay off. Among the anticipatedbenefits, those related to market and customerorientation MARKET are the most importantones in case of both dependent variables;11 it is not surprising that this is particularly pronouncedin case of ESALES. Cost and inputrelated benefits COSTRED, INPUT are only relevant forexplaining the adoption of Internet. Among the obstacles to the adoption of these two ICT elements, insufficient opportunities to benefit from an application NOUSE are an important factorin both cases. With regard to other obstacles, Internet and Internetbased selling are different: forthe former, investment costs and financial restrictions and, even more, knowledge problems deficiencies with respect to qualified manpower, management as well as information problems areimportant INVCOST, KNOWHOW; in the latter case, we find a statistically significant butunpredicted positive sign for uncertainties with respect to technology and performance TECH;this result could reflect the fact that Eselling has been characterised by particularly high uncertainties at an early stage of diffusion see WITSA, 2000. We find no evidence for compatibilityproblems which imply high adjustment costs COMPAT; these are presumably more importantif a whole bundle of ICT elements is introduced rather than a single element see the results for ICT intensity below. We also find, as predicted, that the various dimensions of absorptive capacity as well as the propensity to export strongly stimulate early adoption of the Internet but notthat of Eselling except variable INNOPD. This difference may be compensated for by thestrong effect we find, in case of ESALES, for information spillovers epidemic effects reflecting a particularly strong pressure to keep up to competitors in case of this technology whichis more directly geared to the market than Internet overriding the impact of absorptive capacity.In addition, internal learning from the use of a predecessor technology EDI also plays animportant role in fostering early adoption of Eselling; this result implies that the adjustment 11 The coefficients of the variables measuring the objectives of ICT adoption can be directly compared since theirvalues are standardised; the same holds for the obstacles to adoption. 12 costs a firm incurs when it substitutes Internetbased selling for using EDI are lower than thebenefits to be captured from this change. In case of Internet, firm size dummies, with companiesemploying 500 or more persons as reference group, are negatively related to adoption higherpropensity to adopt in case of large firms; however, beyond a threshold of 200 employees, nosize effects can be detected any more.A closer look at these size effects based on a comparison of the results of specification 4 no sizedummies with those reported for specification 1 size variables included points to a certain interaction between firm size and some variables of the model. For example, when firm size is included in the model, the influence of anticipated benefits decreases; small firms expect thuslower benefits from adoption of Internet and Eselling than large ones what implies later adoption for this sizeclass. There is also some interaction with variables representing absorptive capacity but it is somewhat ambiguous see EDUC vs. INNOPD, and for learning from EDIsmaller impact when size is included implying higher experience effects in case of small firms.In spite of these interactions, the basic pattern of the results remains quite the same pointing tothe robustness of the rank and epidemic effects explicitly modelled in our approach. Interestingly, there is hardly any loss of explanatory power when firm size dummies are dropped. Hence,at least for these two adoption measures, there is no evidence for independent size effects whichwould cover effects not explicitly specified in the model; the results rather point to some sizedependence of the model which will be investigated later on see Section 6.2.Industry dummies construction sector as reference group, which in many cases are statisticallysignificant, are strongly correlated with epidemic effects compare specification 2 and 3. Sincethey are presumed to capture differences among industries with respect to market conditions andtechnological opportunities, this result is not surprising. The other explanatory variables as wellas the model fit are hardly influenced when industry variables are dropped, independent of theadoption variable used see specification 1 vs. 2.Intensity of use of ICTTable 5 shows the results of estimations for two variables representing the intensity of use of ICTbased on an overall measure ICTINT: number of ICT elements and another one referring to the Internet NETUSE: share of employees working with Internet. The structure of the table is thesame as that of Table 4 specification 1 to 4 for both dependent variables. The pattern of explanation is similar for the two intensity variables. More importantly, it is also not much differentfrom that we found for the two variables representing the time period of adoption. However, theexplanatory power of the model explaining the intensity of adoption is higher, quite distinctly incase of the overall intensity ICTINT.There are also some differences of the explanatory pattern between ICT intensity and that capturing the first use of ICT elements; this holds particularly true in case of ICTINT. Firstly, on thebenefit side of anticipated profitability, market and customerorientation is less important incase of both intensity variables, whereas costoriented factors are now more relevant. Secondly,among the obstacles to adoption, investment costs and funding restrictions are a bigger problem 13 indicating that in case of an already larger ICT infrastructure investment needs are increasingtransition to more complex, networkoriented technologies. Similarly, the lack of a potential touse these technologies is higher in case of intensity variables, again a plausible result; if the introduction of one ICT element is already not very promising, the more this holds true when amore intensive application of ICT is to be explained. We respect to knowledge and informationproblems, the comparison of intensity variables and the first use of ICT yields mixed result; thelargest negative impact we find refers to the intensity of use of the Internet, the lowest for theintroduction of Eselling. Thirdly, the capacity to absorb external knowledge is distinctly a moreimportant factor determining adoption when intensity measures are used as dependent variable;this result is plausible in view of the more complex problems to be solved when a large set of ICT elements has already been adopted again: transition to more complex technologies like Intranet, etc  A similar argument holds for difficulties of compatibility which are, against ourprediction, positively correlated with ICT intensity; if the ICT infrastructure is already highlydeveloped, incompatibilities and high adjustment costs may be a more prominent obstacle than incase of ICT adoption from scratch. Fourthly, in case of the two intensity variables we find againsome interaction between firm size and some of the other explanatory variables compare theresults of specification 1 including size dummies vs. 4 where these variables are dropped. However, despite this interaction, and in clear contrast to the estimates explaining the time period ofadoption, the model fit in case of the overall measure of ICT intensity but not regarding NETUSE, an intensity variable referring to a single technology variable is significantly betterwhen size dummies are included. We find thus partial evidence for an independent impact offirm size representing not explicitly specified influences.6.2 Sizedependence of the Adoption Behaviour As just mentioned, firm size is only partially an independent explanatory factor. However, wehave got more evidence of an interaction of firm size with other explanatory variables sizedependence of the model. In the following, we explore the latter aspect by estimating the adoption model separately for small and large firms. In this way we shall see whether the drivingforces behind the adoption of ICT differ between the two size classes We use a threshold of 50employees to separate small from larger firms. This may appear low; however, one should takeinto account that the cutoff point of the sample in terms of firm size is very low 5 employeesand that the sample covers the service and the construction sector as well which are characterisedby a high number of small firms. In addition, it turned out that dummies referring to size classesbeyond 200 employees are insignificant. In view of the low threshold we use size dummieswithin the two size categories of firms with the same reference group as before 500 and moreemployees.In Table 6, we present estimates differentiated by small and larger firms for the time period ofadoption of two ICT elements Internet, Eselling and two intensity variables overall ICT inten 14 sity, intensity of Internet use.12 For both size classes all categories of variables of the modelcontribute significantly to explaining adoption behaviour. The explanatory power of the model ishigher in case of small firms, particularly when the overall ICT intensity and the first use of Internet is used as dependent variable.Taking a closer look at the results reveals some differences between the two size classes withrespect to the role played by individual variables. Firstly, although anticipated benefits have thesame pattern of impact on ICT in qualitative terms there are some important differences withrespect to the magnitude of the parameters as already mentioned, these can be directly comparedsince the variables are standardised. In general, market and customerorientation MARKETand, even more, inputrelated benefits e.g. supplierrelations are of particular relevance in caseof small firms. Considering the obstacles to adoption the differences are larger, in the first instance in case of ICT intensity. Whereas the variable NOUSE lack of a potential to using ICT isa bigger problem for small firms, the opposite is true with regard to the costs of the technology aswell as human and knowledge capital deficiencies information and management problems; lackof qualified persons. These sizespecific differences with respect to the expected net benefitsrevenues net of costs, i.e. obstacles seem to be consistent with the more complex nature of ICT in case of larger firms which more often operate near to the technological frontier and themore urgent need to get a quick return on investments in ICT in small companies either noadoption at all or adoption directly oriented towards input and output markets . However, we donot get a clear sizespecific pattern in case of the ability to absorb external knowledge; the differences are not the same for the three variables representing absorptive capacity, and they vary tosome extent across the four dependent variables. In contrast, there are some differences with respect to the relevance of competition as a factor forcing firms to adopt ICT: exposure to foreigncompetition is a more important driver of adoption for small firms than for larger ones; thisseems plausible since the differences with respect to export propensity are much smaller amonglarge firms. Similarly, epidemic effects are stronger in case of small firms for three out of fouradoption variables; only in case of Internetbased selling, larger firms seem to feel a strongerpressure to follow suit their competitors variable EPIDSALE.In view of these mostly plausible results, this type of analysis seems to be an appropriate instrument to uncover systematic differences of adoption behaviour of firms belonging to differentsize classes. This procedure complements the more traditional analysis of sizeeffects based onparameter estimates for firm size included as a separate variable in an adoption model independent sizeeffects.13 12 Estimates with three firm size classes less than 20, 20 to 99, 100 and more employees yielded similar results.13 For an alternative procedure, i.e. estimation of sizespecific parameters for each explanatory variables in a singleequation framework, see Arvanitis 1997. Experience shows that this method leads to very similar results asseparate estimates for sizespecific subsamples. 15 6.3 The Role of Workplace Organisation Organisational change increases productivity directly and, in particular, when it is complementedwith the use of ICT and accompanied by training measures see Breshnahan et al., 2002. Therefore, one may expect that the adoption of new work practices contributes to intensify the use of ICT or to adopt it at an early point in time. The extended model of adoption, as specified in Section 3, takes account of this proposition.Table 7 shows estimations for this extended model using the intensity of use of ICT as dependentvariable ICTINT. Since our survey yielded information about organisational matters only forfirms with at least 20 employees against a threshold of 5 employees in the rest of the survey wedispose of a reduced dataset of 1667 firms as against 2641 observations in the original sample.14Therefore, to start with, we reestimated the basic model explaining ICTINT see column 1. Thepattern of explanation is more or less the same as based on the larger sample with some smalldifferences easily to be explained: by dropping very small firms variables such as NOUSE noreal potential to use ICT or X propensity to export loose some of their explanatory power. Correspondingly, the model fit is slightly lower reflecting the fact that the model performs particularly well in case of small firms see Section 6.2.Next we estimated the model where the basic specification is complemented with organisationalvariables, either based on various elements of new workplace organisation column 3: teamworking, job rotation, multiskilling, degree of decentralised decisionmaking in production andin contact with users, tendency of decentralising decisionmaking and of flattening hierarchicalstructures during 1995 and 2000, or based on an aggregate measure developed from these organisational elements column 2: ORG4; for details of the variable specification see Table 3b.As can be seen from the two equations, both types of organisational variables exert a statisticallysignificant influence on ICT adoption. Among the individual organisational elements, teamworking, decentralised decisionmaking at the workplace and lowering hierarchical layers are therelevant dimensions of workplace organisation in explaining the use of ICT.However, as revealed by comparing equation 2 and 3 respectively with equation 1, adding organisational variables to the basic model does hardly improve explanatory power. A closer lookat the pattern of explanation shows that including organisational variables reduces, to some extent, the impact of the proxies for human and knowledge capital absorptive capacity as well asof firm size. We find, indeed, highly significant correlation coefficients between 0.20 and 0.30between these variables and organisation. Therefore, we dropped in a first step the three variables representing human and knowledge capital EDUC, TRAINING, INNOPD and, in a second step, also the firm size dummies. This exercise, as equations 4 and 5 show, leads to a substantial increase of the parameter measuring the impact of workplace organisation ORG4 from 14 2% of the firms of the final data set answered the questionnaire although they employed less than 20 persons in 2000; since they had a larger staff according to the census data of 1998 on which the sample was based on, theyalso participated at this part of the survey. For this reason we inserted a dummy S1 also in the extended versionof a model. 16 0.21 to 0.31 and 0.35 respectively; similarly, the coefficient of the objective variable COSTREDrepresenting also elements of workplace organisation optimisation of the production process,improving decisionmaking, improving internal communication; see Table A1 in the Appendixincreases from 0.37 to 0.42 in equation 5 with no change in equation 4. These results indicatethat organisation may interact with human capital as well as with ICT as put forward in recentwork mentioned above and in Section 3.We are also confronted with the problem of endogeneity in estimating the equation of ICT adoption. A simple way to correct for endogeneity of ORG4, representing the change of workplaceorganisation is to introduce a lag between ORG4 and ICTINT. This procedure reflects the assumption made in Breshnahan et al. 2002 according to which organisational adjustments takelonger than changes of technology or human capital endowment. Organisation is considered as aquasifixed factor in the short run, whereas complementarity between the three factors involvedis characteristic for the longer run. Column 6 of Table 7 shows the result of an estimate where, asdependent variable, the intensity of use of ICT planned expected for the year 2003 replaces ICTINT which refers to 2000; in this way, ORG4 is lagged by three years since it is related to theyear 2000 and to changes in the period 19952000. The model fit of this specification is substantially better than that of equation 2 ICT intensity 2000, no lag of ORG4. However, the organisation variable still does not add much to the explanatory power of the basic model. In thesame way as before, inclusion of lagged ORG4 reduces the coefficients of human and knowledgecapital as well as the impact of firm size. Organisation my thus interact with ICT and humancapital even if we take account of lagged effects.A more fundamental way of taking account of such interactions is to look for evidence of thereverse causality, i.e. to investigate whether the adoption of ICT exerts an influence on thechange of workplace organisation. To this end, we specify an equation explaining the adoptionof new work practices where ICT is one of the explanatory variables. The structure of this organisation model is the same as that of the ICT model; it is only the content of the two categories of variables anticipated benefits objectives of organisational change and adjustmentcosts obstacles to organisational innovations which makes the difference. Information about anumber of dimensions of objectives of and obstacles to organisational change stemming alsofrom our survey are again condensed to a few variables using the technique of principal component factor analysis. As a result of this exercise, which is documented in the Appendix Table A4and A5, we obtain two variables representing anticipated benefits of new work practices as wellas three factors depicting barriers to change of workplace organisation. Among the benefits, thevariable PERS represents the potential of exploiting previously untapped human resources byreorganising work strengthening motivation, use of specific knowledge of workers, etc., and COSTLEX stands for the expected gains from reducing costs and enhancing organisational flexibility to adjust to exogenous changes. Insufficient readiness on the workers and management sideis one of the barriers preventing reorganisation HUMAN. The others refer to difficulties encountered in the adjustment process e.g. slow speed of adjustment; variable ADJDIFF and thecosts of organisational adjustments ADJCOST. Another variable representing impediments to 17 organisational innovations, which we did not extract by use of factor analysis, is NONEED, ameasure of the absence of any necessity to changing organisational structures.Table 8 shows the results of estimations of this model explaining the adoption of new workplaceorganisation with column 1 equation without an ICT variable as starting point. Anticipatedbenefits but not impediments, with the exception of variable NONEED, human and knowledgecapital as well as firm size are the most important determinants of the change of workplaceorganisation. The results for the extended version of the organisation model where the basicspecification is complemented with a variable reflecting the intensity of use of ICT are presentedin column 2. It turns out that ICT exerts a statistically significant influence on the adoption ofnew work practices; however, as in the case of the ICT model, the extension hardly improves themodel fit because other variables of the model loose some of their explanatory power firm sizeand, to a lesser extent, human and knowledge capital. We also note that the explanatory powerof the organisation model is substantially lower than that of the ICT model. Dropping thehuman and knowledge capital variables column 4 and, additionally, firm size column 5 produces a strong increase of the coefficient of the ICT intensity from 0.31 to 0.45 and 0.51 respectively, an indication of a significant interaction between ICT intensity, human capital and workorganisation. If ICT intensity is specified as a lagged variable lag of 3 years the model fit doesnot improve column 3; endogeneity can thus not resolved in this way.The results we gained from estimating the extended organisation model and those we foundwith the extended version of the ICT model point in the same direction: ICT intensity andworkplace organisation seem to interact; both directions of causality yield statistically significantresults. This finding is based on estimates in a singleequation framework and should be checkedby a simultaneous estimation; this procedure might also give a hint with respect to the relativemagnitude of the effects in this respect the singleequation framework yields no reliable results.However, we would be quite surprised if simultaneous estimations would substantially the basicconclusion.15 We conclude that our results are in line with those of some recent studies whichfound that ICT, new workplace organisation and human capital are complementary factors toincrease the efficiency of production and the quality of products see e.g. Breshnahan et al., 2002;Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 2000; Bertschek and Kaiser, 2001.7. CONCLUSIONSThe adoption behaviour of Swiss firms in the field of ICT is characterised by a basic pattern ofexplanation which is quite robust across model estimations with different adoption variables. Allcategories of explanatory variables, though to a different extent, are relevant. Most important arevarious dimensions of anticipated benefits and costs of adoption, the firms ability to absorbknowledge from other firms and institutions, information spillovers between firms, experiencewith earlier vintages of a certain technology and international competitive pressure. In addition 15 Another extension would be the estimation of a simultaneous model where human and knowledge capital inputwould also be considered as an endogenous variable. 18 to these firmspecific effects, there is also strong evidence for industry effects with a higherprobability of adoption in some hightech industries, modern services and trade which, amongelse, reflect different technological opportunities. Moreover, there are some interesting differences between the results for the various types of adoption variables first use of specific ICTelements vs. measures of the intensity of ICT use, which in most cases seem plausible.The results strongly confirm the usefulness of modelling anticipated profitability of technologyadoption in more detail than it is the case in most empirical models by taking account of a wholeset of cost and revenue components. It turns out that the adoption of ICT is not only a costreducing technology but has also a great potential to generating product innovations, increasingcustomerorientation, etc  In addition, it is shown that financial and knowhow problems aremore important obstacles to adoption than technological uncertainties and switching costs.The role of firm size, which belongs to the most prominent variables included in models of technology adoption, is analysed in some detail. It turned out that firm size is an independent explanatory variable covering sizespecific variables not explicitly accounted for in the modelonly in case of one of the four adoption measures we used i.e. overall intensity of ICT use.However, the adoption model is shown to be sizedependent, i.e. firm size interacts with otherexplanatory variables. This specific feature of our approach of analysing sizeeffects is able touncover systematic differences of adoption behaviour of firms belonging to different size classes.For example, the analysis of anticipated benefits and costs of adoption shows that small firmschoose either to not engage in ICT at all or to strive at a quick return on ICT investments strongcustomer and supplierorientation; large firms, since they operate nearer to the technologicalfrontier are more often impeded, compared to small ones, by information and knowledge deficiencies, management problems and a lack of specialists. Epidemic effects, i.e. information spillovers between firms, are more important in case of small firms.The analysis with an extended version of our model yielded strong evidence for the influentialrole played by workplace organisation for decisions to adopt ICT or to intensify their use. Teamworking, decentralised decisionmaking and flattening hierarchical structures are the most relevant organisational dimensions favouring the adoption of ICT, whereas we did not find an impactof other elements of workplace organisation such as job rotation or multiskilling. To circumventthe problem of endogeneity of workplace organisation as an explanatory variable, we introducedtime lags and investigated the reverse causality running from the adoption of ICT to the introduction of new work practices; we also found evidence for this relationship. Moreover, humanand knowledge capital turned out to be quite strongly correlated with the adoption of ICT as wellas with new workplace organisation. Our findings are in line with those of some recent studieswhich found that ICT, new workplace organisation and human capital are complementary factorsin strategies to increasing efficiency of production and quality of products.Besides, the paper shows that the proposed model of adoption, which in its core has been developed in an earlier study dealing with Advanced Manufacturing Technologies Arvanitis and Hollenstein, 2001, is useful for other technologies too. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that 19 an analysis of adoption behaviour may profit from the use of qualitative data reflecting firmsassessments; in this way the database for empirical research can be substantially enlarged because this type of information is much easier to collect. Future work should be directed, first, tofurther testing the usefulness of the proposed model of adoption other technologies and countries. Secondly, and more important, there is a need for additional indepth studies of the impactof the adoption of ICT on firm performance; in particular, the hypothesis of complementarity of ICT, workplace organisation and human capital Breshnahan et al., 2002; Brynjolfsson and Hitt,2000; Bertschek and Kaiser, 2001 should be investigated more thoroughly, e.g. in a simultaneous equation framework.As far as policy is concerned, the empirical results support rather a frameworkoriented policydesign than a more activist policy orientation. The most important bottlenecks in introducing ICTand intensifying their use that can be reduced by policy measures are deficiencies of ICTspecificknowledge and a lack of specialists as well as corresponding information problems. Therefore,policy should strengthen, in the first place, the human capital infrastructure of the economy byintensifying vocational education at the secondary and tertiary level as well as recurrent training. In addition, since ICT marks a fundamental change of the production system of practicallyall industries and in view of the significant role of learning effects it could be sensible to supporttemporarily ICTspecific training programmes oriented, in the first place, towards smaller companies in the early phase of adoption.References Arvanitis, S. 1997, The Impact of Firm Size on Innovative Activity An Empirical Analysis Based on Swiss Firm Data, Small Business Economics, 9, 473490.Arvanits, S. and H.
