Amongst one million placebos, there is no other constellation of state grouping that would yield a larger border effect. The finding is robust over different econometric models, treatment of the rest of the world, available survey waves, or levels of aggregation. Including contemporaneous controls, such as network, institutional or demographic variables, and HeckscherOhlin or Linder terms, lowers the estimate only slightly. Historical variables, such as the incidence of slavery, do not explain the effect away. Adding US states unaffected by the Civil War, we argue that the friction is not merely reflecting unmeasured NorthSouth differences. Finally, the estimated border effect is larger for differentiated than for homogeneous goods, stressing the potential role for cultural factors and trust. JEL Code: F15, N72, N92, Z10.

And that 4 in 10 Southerners sympathize with the Confederacy.But does the long defunct border between the Confederation and the Union stillaffect economic relations between US states that belonged to different alliancestoday? Is the former border still relevant, still divisive? This paper sheds lighton this question using bilateral trade flows between states.The Civil war has cost 620,000 American lives, more than any other militaryconflict. Golden and Lewis 1975 document that it has retarded the economicdevelopment of the whole nation and of the South in particular. And, as the Pew poll shows, the nation is still divided along the lines of the former alliancesover whether the war was fought over moral issues slavery or over economicpolicy. Yet, long before the war, the Southern and the Northern economies differed: The South was dominated by largescale plantations of cotton, tobacco,rice, and sugar, whose profitability relied on forced labor. It exported crops to Europe and imported manufacturing goods from there. The North, dominatedby smaller landholdings, was rapidly urbanizing; slavery was practically abolished north of the MasonDixon Line by 1820.2 Its infant manufacturing industries were protected by import tariffs against European competition.The NorthSouth divide is very visible in contemporaneous statelevel data.On average, the South is still poorer, more rural, more agricultural, less educated, more religious, and has different political views. The economic gap mayhave narrowed Michener and Mc Lean, 1999, in particular after the end of segregation in the Sixties of the last century. But, political disagreement, in particular on the role of federal government, continues to beset the country. A special 1Pew Research Centre for the People and the Press, Civil War at 150: Still Relevant, Still Divisive, Apri 8, 2011; available at http:pewresearch.orgpubs1958.2The MasonDixon Line settled a conflict between British Colonies in America and set thecommon borders of Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, and West Virginia.TRADE AND THE AMERICAN SECESSION3sense of Southern identity continues to mark a cultural divide within the US.This paper contributes to a growing literature on the longshadow of history for economic transactions Nitsch and Wolf, 2009; Falck et al., 2010; Headet al., 2010. It shows that the former border still constitutes a discontinuityin the economic geography of the United States. The modern literature hasidentified cultural differences across countries as impediments of internationaltrade, but typically not within the same country. Estimates of various border effects abound in the literature and there are welltested empirical methods tomeasure their tradeinhibiting force. The more challenging question in this paper is: Can the estimated border effect be interpreted as a genuine UnionvsConfederation effect?We proceed in three steps. First, employing the theoryconsistent but parsimonious gravity model of Anderson and van Wincoop 2003, henceforth Av W,for bilateral trade between states, we find a robust, statistically significant, andeconomically meaningful tradeinhibiting effect of the former border. In thepreferred 1993 data, on average, the historical border reduces trade betweenstates of the former Confederation or Union between 22 and 16 percent. Incomparison, the CanadaUS border restricts trade by 155 to 165 percent Av W.Nitsch and Wolf 2011 find that the former border between East and West Germany restricts trade by about 26 to 30 percent in 2004. Running a million placebos, we show that no other border between random groups of old US statesyields a stronger tradereducing effect. The result is robust to employing alternative methodologies, using different waves of the Commodity Flow Survey1997, 2002, 2007, drawing on sectoral rather than aggregate bilateral tradedata, or measuring transportation costs differently travel time instead of sheergeographical distance. Including the rest of the world, or different treatment ofstates, whose allegiance to either the Union or the Confederation is historicallynot obvious, does not change the results. The estimated border effect represents an ad valorem tariff equivalent of about 2 to 8 percent. Interestingly, theeffect is stronger and more robust in the food, manufacturing, and chemicals4FELBERMAYR AND GROSCHLsectors than in mining, which is characterized by a completely standardizedgood, or machinery, where the pattern of specialization across North and Southis very strong.In a second step, we add a large array of contemporaneous variables to theoriginal Av W model to account for observable differences between the Southand the North. The controls are meant to capture migrant, ethnic, or religiousnetworks. While these variables matter empirically, they do not reduce the estimated border effect. We account for cultural differences expressed by differentcolonial relations across states, for different patterns of urbanization, and foradditional geographical variables. We include variables that relate to the institutional setup of states, or that measure differences in the judicial system.We control for differences in endowment proportions, or for differences in thestructure of the states economies. Finally, we add demographic factors and testthe Linder hypothesis. Most of these controls have some explanatory power,but they do not undo the border effect. The estimate falls from 16 to 13 percent. This finding survives the same battery of robustness checks applied to theparsimonious model.Third, we acknowledge that the NorthSouth border, marked by the Secession, is likely not to be exogenous. Engerman and Sokoloff 2000 and 2005 suggest that it is related to endowment differences between Northern and Southernstates in cropland, or in the size and structure of agricultural production. Theemergence of the border may have to do with historical ethnic patterns, historical educational achievements of the population, or institutional differences ascaptured by the historical incidence of malaria as in Acemoglu et al. 2002. Finally, and most importantly, it may result from the incidence of slavery. Not allof these variables matter empirically for contemporaneous trade patterns, butthey cannot easily be excluded from the explanation of contemporaneous bilateral trade on conceptual grounds. Including them into the gravity equationdoes not undo the Secession effect. Quite to the opposite, the estimated effectactually increases. Finally, we extend the analysis to Western states, but keepTRADE AND THE AMERICAN SECESSION5the same coding of the border. Thus, we add pairs of states which have beencompletely unaffected by the Secession. Then, the border dummy essentiallycaptures whether two states have been on opposing sides of the Civil War ratherthan belonging to the North or the South. We continue to find a border effect 7to 18 percent, which can now be attributed more plausibly to the Secession.The literature offers explanations of border effects in terms of political barriers, artefact, and fundamentals. The first should be largely absent in an integrated economy such as the US. The second relates to difficulties in separating the impact of borderrelated trade barriers from the impact of geographicaldistance Head and Mayer, 2002 or to problems of statistical aggregation Hillberry and Hummels, 2008. We deal with these issues by using alternative measures of trade costs and by a large amount of placebo exercises. We view ourresults as consistent with the fundamentals approach: historical events haveshaped cultural determinants of trade which still matter today.The literature on border effects was pioneered by Mc Callum 1995, whofinds that trade volumes between Canadian provinces were about 22 times largerthan those between Canada and the US in 1988. Subsequent research 3 showsthat states usually trade 5 to 20 times more domestically than internationally.Few studies have moved from simply exploring border barriers to investigatingand explaining potential causes. Wei 1996 and Hillberry 1999 do not findthat tariffs, quotas, exchange rate variability, transaction costs, and regulatorydifferences can explain the border effect. Recent studies illustrate that the impact of borders also extends to the subnational level, implying that additionalreasons for high local trade levels must exist. Examples are Wolf 1997 and 2000, Hillberry and Hummels 2003, Combes et al. 2005, Buch and Toubal2009, and Nitsch and Wolf 2009.The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section I. provides de3Helliwell 1997, 1998, 2002; Wei 1996, Hillberry 1999, 2002; Wolf 1997, 2000; Nitsch2000; Parsley and Wei 2001; Hillberry and Hummels 2003; Av W 2003; Chen 2004; Feenstra 2004; Combes et al. 2005; Millimet and Osang 2005; Baier and Bergstrand 2009; Buchand Toubal 2009; Nitsch and Wolf 2009 to name only a few.6FELBERMAYR AND GROSCHLtails of the empirical strategy. Section II. describes the benchmark results,placebo estimations and a sensitivity analysis. Section III. uses a large array ofcontemporaneous controls to address a potential omitted variables problem.While Section IV. attempts to explain the Secession effect by historical variables and by adding Western states to the analysis. The last section concludes.I. Empirical Strategy and Data A. Empirical Strategy Our empirical strategy follows Anderson and van Wincoop 2003 and the subsequent research. Based on a multicountry framework of the Krugman 1980constant elasticity of substitution model with iceberg trade costs, the literaturestresses that the consistent estimation of bilateral barriers requires to take multilateral trade resistance into account. In this paper, we use the nonlinear leastsquares NLS model suggested by Av W 2003 to estimate the border effect.We also employ an approach that uses state specific fixed effects to control formultilateral resistance. Finally, we implement the idea of Baier and Bergstrand2009 to linearize the model by help of a first order expansion of the multilateral resistance terms. In all setups, we proxy trade costs by geographical distance and the historical border between the former alliances of states in the Union and the Confederacy.Av W 2003 show that the CES demand system with symmetric trade costscan be written asln zij 0 1Borderij 2 ln Distij Xij ln P 1P 1ke 1Borderkj 2 ln Distkj ,P 1kjcid:88i ln P 1j ij, 12kand zij xij Yi Yj is the value of bilateral exports xij between state i and statej relative to the product of the states GDPs, Yi and Yj. 0 is a constant acrossstate pairs, 1 1 and 2 1, where 1 is the elasticity ofTRADE AND THE AMERICAN SECESSION7substitution. Borderij 1 ij represents the historical border line between Union and Confederate states, which takes a value of unity if states in the pairhistorically belonged to opposing alliances and zero otherwise. ln Distij is thelog of geographical distance between states. Xij denotes a vector of additionalcontrols. Av W set 0 and focus on a parsimonious gravity model. In ourexercise, we switch on and off and work with various vectors Xij. k is theshare of income of state k in world income; ij is the standard error term.ijand ln P 1The complication with estimating that model is that the multilateral resistance terms ln P 1depend on estimates of 1 and 2 in a nonlinearfashion. Av W 2003 propose estimating their gravity model by means of an iterative procedure that minimizes the sum of squared residuals in 1, while simultaneously using 2 to obtain values for the multilateral resistance terms.Baier and Bergstrand 2009 propose to apply a first order linear expansionto 2, to solve for the multilateral price indices, and substitute the solutioninto 1. The ensuing log linear equation can be estimated by means of simple OLS. In the present case, this amounts to including multilateral resistance MRterms for distance MRDistij and the border MRBorderij into the equation.Finally, we follow a large strand of literature Hummels, 1999; Av W, 2003;Feenstra, 2004; Redding and Venables, 2004 and apply origin and destinationfixed effects in an OLS gravity regression. The fixed effects capture all timeinvariant origin and destination specific determinants, such as multilateral resistance terms, but also geographical characteristics and historical or culturalfacts. In that sense, this model is more general than the two other ones, since itaccounts for any countrylevel unobserved heterogeneity.B. Data Sources For within and crossstate trade flows, we focus on bilateral export data fromthe 1993, 1997, 2002, and 2007 Commodity Flow Surveys CFS collected by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. The CFS tracks shipments in net sellingvalues in millions of dollars. The CFS covers 200,000 100,000; 50,000; 100,0008FELBERMAYR AND GROSCHLrepresentative US firms for 1993 1997; 2002; 2007. The literature is concernedabout the low number of firms surveyed in the waves after 1993, see Erlebaumet al. 2006. For this reason, existing studies have usually focused on the 1993wave which represents about 25 percent of registered US firms; we follow in thistradition. GDP by state stems from the Regional Economic Accounts, providedby the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Bilateral distance is calculated as the greatcircle distance between state capitals. Intrastate distance is measured as in Wei1996 as the quarter of the distance between a state and its closest neighbor.4FIGURE 1Union versus Confederate States Our primary sample consists of 28 US states divided into two groups thatoriginate from the split caused by the Secession as shown in Figure 1. The South comprises 11 states, while the North consists of 17 states, as listed in Table 1. Five states Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri and West Virginia are excluded from the benchmark sample since soldiers from these statesfought on both sides of the Civil War and the allegiance to either group of statesis unclear. Still today, these five states do not belong to the fuzzily defineddeep South.5 Somewhat abusing terminology, we call these 5 states border 4This is the common practice in the literature, see also Av W 2003, Feenstra 2004, as wellas Baier and Bergstrand 2009.5Reed and Reed 1997 define the deep South as an area roughly coextensive with the oldTRADE AND THE AMERICAN SECESSION9states. We conduct sensitivity analysis with respect to the choice of excludingthose states.TABLE 1Sample North Union South Confederacy Excluded Border States Delaware Kentucky Maryland Missouri West Virginia Alabama Arkansas Florida Georgia Louisiana Mississippi North Carolina South Carolina Tennessee Virginia Connecticut Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Maine Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota New Hampshire Texas New Jersey New York Ohio Pennsylvania Rhode Island Vermont Wisconsin Table 2 shows averages and standard deviations for the year of 1993 ofthe variables used in this study. Southern states have on average substantiallylarger shares of AfroAmericans 22.9 versus 7.4 percent; the share of Christians is higher while the share of Jewish citizens is smaller 0.8 versus 2.1 percent. The percentage share of urban population is lower in South than in North65.6 versus 72.9. Historically as of 1860, average farm sizes were substantially larger in the South than in the North; this gap has closed since then. Thesame is true for educational outcomes illiteracy and average schooling. The GDP per capita average across the South is about 12 percent lower than the avcotton belt from eastern North Carolina through South Carolina west into East Texas, with extensions north and south along the Mississippi.10FELBERMAYR AND GROSCHLerage across the North. The most dramatic differences in 1993 data pertain toinstitutional variables: The North is much more unionized than the South. All Northern states had a minimum wage while only 45 percent of the Southernstates had one. In the 1992 presidential election, 64 percent of Southern statesvoted Republican while only 12 of Northern states did.6II. The Effect of the Former UnionConfederation Border A. Benchmark Results Estimating equation 1 allows assessing the average impact of the border oncrossborder NorthSouth trade flows relative to within region flows. Table 3provides our benchmark results for the year of 1993. Estimates of the Av W2003 NLS model are shown in column 1. In line with the gravity literature,the estimated elasticity of distance is very close to 1. The coefficient on theborder variable in column 1 indicates that the border reduces trade flows between the North and the South by about 19.6 percent e 0.218 1 in 1993. Thatestimate is statistically significant at the 1 percent level. This is the same as tosay that within trade is by the factor 1.24 e 0.218 bigger than between trade.The associated ad valorem tariff equivalent of the border is 2.5 to 11.5 percent,depending on the choice of elasticity of substitution.7 Compared to international border effects, this is quite a reasonable amount for a barrier to trade onthe subnational level caused by an event more than a century ago. Av W 2003find that crossborder trade for the CanadaUS case is about 80.8 percent lowerthan within trade.8 This amounts to a tariff equivalent of 20 to 128 percent. Results by Nitsch and Wolf 2011 suggest that the former EastWest border within 6NorthSouth differences are also clearly visible when looking at pairs of states. Table A1 inthe Web Appendix differentiates between the sample of all pairs N 768 and the sample ofcrossborder pairs states from different sides of the historical border; N 364.7Broda et al. 2006 estimate elasticities of substitution with a median of 3.8 and a mean of 12.1. The elasticity of substitution they estimate for the US is 2.4. We follow the recent literatureand calculate tariff equivalents according to a range of the elasticity of substitution between 3and 10.8Table 2 in Av W, twocountry model: e 1.65 1.TRADE AND THE AMERICAN SECESSION11TABLE 2Summary Statistics by State, 1993Unit of Observation: State Level Sample Variable North N 17Mean Std.

Under fixedeffects, crossborder trade is on average 14.5 percent smaller than within region trade. Hence, the border equals a tariff of 2 to 8 percent. The FE estimateis very close to that obtained under NLS. This is in line with Feenstra 2004,who also finds a slightly smaller but comparable effect to the Av W 2003 estimation in the CanadaUS case. In column 3, we use two indicator variablesto measure withingroup trade relative to crossborder trade separately for the North and the South. We find that trade within the South is 1.78 times largerthan crossborder trade with the North in 1993. Contrarily, the North trades 1.3times less within the region than across the border. This result is interesting aswe expect to find a positive sign on both indicator variables. The strong positiveimpact on within South trade and the much smaller negative impact on within North trade could relate to current account imbalances within the US. As statesin the North run on average a current account surplus, the North trades morewith the South than with itself. States in the South, however, run on averagea current account deficit and thus trade more among themselves and with the North. However, that result is not robust; see column 6.10In column 4, we estimate a multicountry model. We consider trade between US states, between 20 OECD countries 11 and exports from individual USstates to OECD countries 12 into the fixed effects model of column 2. We use OECD trade, distance and GDP data provided by Av W and US state exports to 9Table 2a in Nitsch and Wolf 2011, pooled OLS in 2004: e 0.229 1.10This result vanishes when counting the border states into the South Table A6 of the Web Appendix, or when adding Western states to the analysis Table 9.11These include Canada, Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Austria, BelgiumLuxembourg, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain,Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.12We focus on exports from US states to the OECD as import data of individual US states from OECD states and vice versa are not available.TRADE AND THE AMERICAN SECESSION13OECD countries from Robert Feenstras webpage.13 Column 4 reports that thedistance parameter remains close to 1, while the border reduces NorthSouthtrade within the US by 16.9 percent.

The border impeding trade effect between the North and the South persists with a magnitude of 15 percent. In column 6, we find that tradewithin the South is 1.59 times larger than crossborder trade in 1993, while thecoefficient for the North turns insignificant.In the final step we explore the CFS data in more detail, as disaggregatedtrade flows at the commodity level are available. This is in the spirit of Hillberry1999, who estimated commodity specific border effects for products tradedbetween Canada and the US in 1993. We pool over all commodities available inthe specific year. As commodities are subject to varying transportation costs, weinclude origincommodity and destinationcommodity fixed effects following Chen 2004. For 1993, results for the pooled commodity FE estimation are depicted in Table 3 column 7. We find that the border reduced NorthSouth tradeby about 8.6 percent.Following Av W 2003, we use the model and the parameter estimates tosimulate the ratio of trade with border barriers BB to the counterfactual levelof trade under borderless trade NB.footnote Detailed results are in Table A4 in the Web Appendix. Multilateral resistance increases by 6 percent for states of the South, but only by 1 percent forthose of the North. Moreover, SouthSouth trade rises by 12 percent due to theborder, while NorthNorth trade increases by only 3 percent.B. Placebo Estimations Is there something special about trade across the former UnionConfederationborder as opposed to trade across other hypothetical borders? To deal with thisquestion, we randomly assign 11 out of the 28 old US states to a hypothetical South and the remainder to a hypothetical North.15 Based on regression 215The number of potential South subsamples and hence of state groups is huge: 21,474,180.Estimating all possible border effects between these groups of states is computationally exTRADE AND THE AMERICAN SECESSION15of Table 3, we run a million placebo regressions. We find a negative and significant at the 10% level border effect in 13.4 percent of the cases. In 56 casesthe border effect is slightly larger than the 15.7 percent found in our benchmarkcase. The largest effect we find is 1.6 percentagepoints larger than our originaleffect, but the standard error is so large that one cannot reject the hypothesis that the effect is identical to the 15.7 benchmark result. In all 56 cases, the South consists predominantly of New England and the Great Lakes States.Placebo Estimations.

Sensitivity Analysis Table 4 summarizes border effect estimates obtained from using the 1997, 2002or 2007 waves of the Commodity Flow Survey rather than the more reliable 1993data. Across the nonlinear Av W procedure, the fixedeffects model, the Baierand Bergstrand 2009 approach, and the the commoditylevel regression, wefind negative border effects that are all statistically significant at the 1% level.Interestingly, there is no evidence that the border effect shrinks over time. Comparison across time is hindered by different sampling across waves. The formerborder reduces trade by between 9 and 18 percent, with the average effect clustering around at about 14 percent.The use of geographical distance as a measure of transportation costs hasbeen criticized by Head and Mayer 2002. Since 71 to 75 percent of shipmentsin the US are transported by truck Department of Transportation, we use actual travel time from Google maps as an alternative measure of transportationcosts. Ozimek and Miles 2011 provide a tool to retrieve these data. We findthat the use of travel time reduces the estimated border effect in the preferred 1993 sample from 15 to 11 percent, thereby confirming the hypothesis that geographical distance inflates the estimated border effects. However, across waves,the effect remains negative and statistically significant.1716In further placebo exercises, we investigate border effects between coastal and interiorstates as well as between Eastern and Western states in the whole US. Results are containedin Table A2 of the Web Appendix. We do not find a border effect between coastal and interior states. There is no border effect neither at a hypothetical EastWest border approximatelydrawn at the 90 longitude line.17The 1997 wave with its 50,000 sampled firms is an exception.

We find that the assignment of thoseborder states does not matter qualitatively for our findings. Estimated effectsare slightly lower than when border states are excluded altogether.18D. Estimates by Sector Finally, we also run regressions sectorbysector. Table 5 provides summary results, suppressing other coefficients except the one on the border dummy.19The estimated border effect is 1 cid:92 1, thereby confounding the elasticity of substitution and the tradecost increasing effect of the border. It is therefore not surprising, that the low agricultural sector features a high but onlymoderately robust estimate, while the low mining sector does not display anyborder effect. There is no border effect in the machinery sector, neither. This ispresumably due to NorthSouth differences in comparative advantage that thesimple Av W model does not capture. The border effect is most pronounced inthe chemical and manufacturing sectors, where the degree of product differentiation is high hence, low. This finding supports the view that the formerborder reflects a cultural divide that makes transactions more difficult and thatthis is most pronounced in highly differentiated industries.III. Accounting for Observed Contemporaneous Heterogeneity A. Benchmark Results In this section we investigate, whether observable characteristics of state pairs,omitted in the parsimonious Av Wregressions above, bias the estimated coefficient. We include a large number of contemporaneous determinants of tradethat are discussed in the empirical literature stepwise into the regression.

The product of variables relates to network effects between pairs,20FELBERMAYR AND GROSCHLwhile the operator focuses on the difference between state pairs.20 Table 6reports results for our benchmark year 1993. All estimations include origin anddestination fixed effects.Column 1 of Table 6 adds a single geographical variable to the basic setup:adjacency. This variable is routinely included in gravity equations, but does notfigure in the Av W setup. In our sample, and in accordance with the literature,adjacency increases bilateral trade by about 45 percent. Due to the omissionof border states from our baseline estimations, adjacency correlates negativelywith the border. If adjacency increases trade, its omission would bias the bordereffect away from zero. This is exactly what we find: the border effect falls inabsolute terms from 0.157 Table 3 column 2 to 0.115.21In column 2, we account for the impact of ethnic, religious, or cultural networks Rauch, 1999; Rauch and Trindade, 2002; Combes et al., 2005 and migration within the US Helliwell, 1997; Head and Ries, 1998; Millimet and Osang,2007. The literature reasons that common culture and tastes increase tradeflows as they facilitate contracts and instill trust; they also make it more likelythat states produce and consume similar goods. Migration and networks mightbias the border effect estimate upwards as they increase trade but are negativelyassociated with the border. To test the impact of networks we include i crossstate migration stocks of people residing in one state but were born in anothertaken from the American Community Survey Decennial Census; ii the productof the share of AfroAmericans in total state population from the Population Estimates Program; iii the product of the Jewish population in total state population from the American Jewish Yearbook; and iv selfreported affinity to Christianity, other religious groups, or no religion from the ARIS 2008 Report, into theestimation. We find that migration networks, high shares of AfroAmericans, ofpopulation shares affiliated to Buddhism, Hinduism or Islam, and of people notselfidentifying with any religious group spur trade flows. A 1 percent increase 20We tried a range of other variables and combinations, as well as network and differencevariables separately and combinations thereof. The results are robust to these modifications.21Clearly, not including adjacency biases all coefficients.TRADE AND THE AMERICAN SECESSION21TABLE 6Contemporaneous Controls, 1993 fixedeffects estimationDependent Variable: ln bilateral exports between i and j relative to states GDPs Border Dummyij Geographical Controlsln Distanceij Adjacencyij Network ControlsHome Biasln Migration Stockij Black Shareij Jewish Shareij Christian Shareij Other Religion Shareij No Religion Shareij Urban Shareij Home Biasij Common Colonizerij Labor MarketPolitical Institutions Union Membershipij Union Densityij Minimum Wageij Republicanij Judiciary Electionij HeckscherOhlin Controls ln CapitalLabor Ratioij ln HighLow Skilled Ratioij ln Average Schoolingij ln Croplandij ln Farm Sizeij ln Agricultural to Total Outputij ln Manufacturing to Total Outputij Demography ln Populationij ln Population Densityij ln Fertilityij Linder Hypothesis ln Income per Capitaij1234560.115 0.124 0.126 0.122 0.132 0.1300.030.030.040.040.040.040.980 0.580 0.570 0.562 0.548 0.5500.050.040.050.446 0.335 0.341 0.362 0.381 0.3840.060.050.050.050.050.050.050.050.050.040.0010.000.0060.000.0020.000.0410.030.0090.010.040.040.001 0.0010.000.000.0060.0080.000.000.0010.0020.000.000.0510.0530.030.030.0110.0110.010.010.182 0.179 0.151 0.150 0.1470.040.030.0010.0000.000.000.0060.0090.000.000.0020.0010.000.000.0410.0510.030.030.0110.0090.010.014.001 3.860 4.317 4.344 4.3690.900.741.120.360 0.349 0.3620.2430.120.130.130.186 0.193 0.168 0.166 0.1670.040.040.770.2900.120.040.131.120.040.040.0270.020.0290.020.2100.150.0010.030.0580.030.0310.020.0330.020.2530.150.0000.030.0660.030.1670.150.0590.090.9241.120.0360.020.0380.020.2250.150.0010.030.0650.030.1620.150.0620.091.0161.130.0380.020.0400.020.2230.150.0010.030.0640.030.1190.180.0650.091.2361.240.048 0.045 0.0450.020.0500.050.0270.040.2030.100.020.0240.070.0020.040.1770.100.0290.030.0390.040.4930.410.020.0200.070.0020.040.1550.110.0300.030.0390.040.4660.410.1320.287680.884768Observations 0.911Adjusted R2Notes: Importer and exporter fixed effects included in all regressions.

Specifically, wefollow the literature and include an indicator variable that is unity for withinstate trade and zero otherwise. The estimate is significant in column 2 andsuggests that trade is on average 24 percent larger within a state than acrossstates. Our estimate is half the size what is on average found in the literature onthe US, using identical data but more parsimonious models Wolf, 2000; Hillberry and Hummels, 2003; Millimet and Osang, 2007; Coughlin and Novy, 2009.The home bias effect relates to informational frictions, such as transaction andsearch costs, that lead to spacial clustering of economic activity within states.However, as we control for networks that partly capture these determinants thehome bias effect is strongly reduced. In addition, common colonial heritage,also included in column 2, may have lasting effects on bilateral trade.24 Weconstruct an indicator variable that takes value one if a pair of states had a common colonizer Britain, France or Spain and zero otherwise. We find that acommon colonial past increases bilateral trade by about 19 percent. Yet, whilemost of those network variables matter statistically, they do not reduce the estimated border effect. If at all, they leave it slightly higher.Column 3 examines the impact of labor market and political institutions.We control for labor market institutions by including dissimilarities in unionmembership and density from Hirsch et al. 2001, as well as a dummy for theexistence of minimum wage legislation provided by the US Department of Labor. In theory, differences in labor market institutions could increase bilateraltrade, because differential legislation acts as a source of comparative advantageas in Cunat and Melitz 2009. In our analysis, we find that institutional differences tend to reduce trade albeit statistical precision of estimates is low.22A similar effect has been identified by Combes et al. 2005 for trade within France.23100 exp0.124 1.24See, for instance, Head et al. 2010.TRADE AND THE AMERICAN SECESSION23This may signal that institutional differences are caused by some deeper differences in cultural norms and that the latter discourage trade by more. Column3 also controls for differences in the political alignment in the 1992 presidential election Clinton against Bush sen. and whether states elect or appointthe judiciary. Voting behavior has no statistically measurable effect on trade,while the difference in judiciary appointment procedure turns out to depressbilateral trade flows. The estimated border effect, however, remains virtuallyunchanged.In column 4, we include controls for the difference in relative factor endowments of states, thereby accounting for the HeckscherOhlin trade theory.Omitting differences in factor proportions might lead to an upward bias of theborder coefficient, as differences in factor proportions should increase tradeflows and appear to be more pronounced when the border is present. To measure contemporaneous differences in relative factor proportions and humancapital accumulation, we include the absolute difference in i capitallaborshares from Turner et al. 2008; ii shares of high and low skilled in the population 25; iii average years of schooling for the population over 25 from Turner etal. 2007; iv cropland from the National Resource Inventory Summary Report;v average farm size from the Census of Agriculture ; vi agricultural relative tototal output; and vii manufacturing relative to total output from the Bureauof Economic Analysis. As in other gravity exercises, classical HeckscherOhlinvariables do not show up statistically significant, though both the variables onthe difference in the capitallabor ratio and the difference in relative skill endowment bear the right sign. Differences in the availability of cropland reducebilateral trade, as do differences in the share of manufacturing output. Contemporaneous differences in factor endowments do not capture the border, whichstill reduces NorthSouth trade by 11.5 percent.2625We measure high skilled by a Bachelors degree or above and low skilled by a High Schooldegree or below. Data stem from the Census of Population and the American Community Survey.26100 exp0.122 1.24FELBERMAYR AND GROSCHLColumn 5 includes demographic variables such as the difference in contemporaneous population and population density from the Population Estimates Program, as well as fertility rates from the Vital Statistics of the United States. Common demographic features across states may suggest common preferences, so that bilateral trade is larger for such states. The estimated parameters, however, are insignificant throughout. The border effect remains negativeand significant.Finally, following the literature on the Linder effect, we include the difference in the log of per capita income as in Thursby and Thursby 1987,Bergstrand 1989, and Hallak2010. The hypothesis is that states with dissimilar GDP per capita should have differing preference structures and, hence,trade less. Since the border correlates negatively with GDP per capita in thedata, omitting the Linder term may bias the border effect away from zero. Thisis, however, not what we find. In column 6, we fail to find support for the Linder hypothesis; the estimated border effect does not move. We have also experimented with direct measures of inequality Gini coefficients, but withoutsuccess.Column 6 represents our most comprehensive and preferred model. Theborder effect is about 12.2 percent.27 It explains more than 91 percent of thevariation in bilateral trade flows, 85 percent of which are attributable to included variables and controls.28B. Sensitivity Analysis Table 7 summarizes sensitivity results pertaining to the comprehensive modelin column 6 of Table 6.29 Panel A deploys the FE approach. Our baseline border effect of 0.130 is reported in column A1. We find a negative and significant 27100 exp0.130 1.28A model that explains bilateral trade solely using importer and exporter fixed effects canonly explain 6 percent of the variation in the dependent variable.

This does not change any results.29Details are relegated to Table A8 in the Web Appendix.TRADE AND THE AMERICAN SECESSION25border effect for 1993 and 2002, while the effect for 1997 and 2007 remains negative but insignificant. Results based on the commodity flow survey from 1997onwards suffer from the fact that the number of firms surveyed is only 50,000or 25 percent of those surveyed in 1993. In Panel B we turn to our model thatincludes MR terms directly in the estimation. The border barrier turns out tobe strong in 1993 and 1997 using the MR approach. If we use the pooled commodity FE setup with importercommodity and destinationcommodity fixedeffects following Chen 2004 in Panel C, we find strong trade impeding effectfor all years. Overall, we can conclude that the findings on the border effectcompare well, both qualitatively and quantitatively, to our earlier results. Theborder reduces crossborder trade by 7 to 19 percent, depending on the yearand the specification.30IV. Accounting for Historical Determinants A. Benchmark Results The economic literature on the emergence of armed conflicts shows that strongbilateral trade links decrease the probability that two countries go to war, whilemultilateral openness increases the odds of conflict Martin et al., 2008. If determinants of bilateral trade are persistent over time, the border could not beconsidered exogenous in the statistical sense. Historical bilateral trade datais, however, not available. But, one can include historical variables that may,through their impact on historical trade patterns, affect the probability of conflict and thus the incidence of the border. Moreover, Eichengreen and Irwin1998 suggest that history might affect contemporaneous trade flows throughpersistent effects on institutions.According to Engerman and Sokoloff 2000 and 2005, dissimilarities in agri30When we work with sectoral data and include the additional controls, results suggests thatthe trade impeding effect is mainly caused by barriers to manufacturing products in all years.Compared to our earlier results, the border effect is negative but less robust for agriculture andchemicals except for 2002. Mining and machinery products again depict in most cases anindistinguishable coefficient from zero.

Thedifferent economic models may have longlasting effects on inequality withinstates, which may, in turn, be relevant for todays level of economic transactionsLinder effect. It may also have persistent effects on institutions, which affectcontemporaneous bilateral trade. The historical settlement structure may haveinduced networks along cultural lines that survived over time.31 Absolute differ31The analysis relates to the literature on the longterm impact of factor endowments andTRADE AND THE AMERICAN SECESSION27ences in historical variables are positively correlated to the border, so that theiromission may bias the estimated border effect away from zero.To account for these possibilities, Table 8 includes historical differences in icropland; ii average farms size; iii population density; and iv illiteracy ratesof the nonslave population.32 In column 1 to 3, we find that none of thesevariables matter statistically, except for historical farm size differences whichare significant at the 10 percent level. Including farm size increases rather thendecreases the border coefficient to 0.230. This is surprising as historical farmsize differences correlate positively with the border.One would expect the legacy of slavery to partly capture the border barrierin column 4. However, we find that differences in slave shares in 1860 exert noimpact on bilateral trade patterns and do not explain away the border barrier.33Interestingly, the inclusion of the absolute difference in shares of free blacks in 1860 exerts a positive and significant effect on contemporaneous trade.In addition, similarities in culture due to similar settlement structures in USstates before the war could have induced social and business networks thathave survived over time and still affect trade. We therefore include the product in the shares of French, Spanish, Irish, British and German settlers in 1860.While Spanish heritage has no particular impact on trade, Irish heritage decreases bilateral trade significantly in column 5. States with a large share of French settlers trade more amongst each other. The same is true for states withhigh shares of German or British settlers, but the impact of German networksvanishes with the inclusion of further variables in subsequent columns.According to Acemoglu et al.2002, historical climatic differences measured by the incidence of malaria, may have affected the characteristics andinstitutions Acemoglu et al., 2002; Nunn, 2009; Galor et al., 2009.32Additionally, all models include our additional contemporaneous controls from Table 6 column 6 and importer as well as exporter fixed effects.33If we use the difference in the share of slaves in 1840, when there were still slaves also livingin the North, we still find robust results on the border effect but an insignificant coefficientclose to zero for the slave share. In column 7, the effect of differences in 1840 slaves is stillzero, while that of the illiterate of the nonslave population turns significant and positive. Theborder effect remains negative and significant on the 1 percent level.28FELBERMAYR AND GROSCHLContemporaneous and Historical Controls, 1993 fixedeffects estimationTABLE 8Dependent Variable: ln bilateral exports between i and j relative to states GDPs1234567Border Dummyij Controls as of Table 6column 6 included Historical Controls ln 1860 Croplandij ln 1860 Farm Sizeij ln 1860 Population Densityij ln 1860 Illiteracy Ratesij 1860 Slave Shareij 1860 Free Black Shareij 1860 French Shareij 1860 Spanish Shareij 1860 Irish Shareij 1860 German Shareij 1860 British Shareij 1860 Malaria Riskij0.230 0.132 0.159 0.155 0.130 0.141 0.2350.100.040.070.060.040.080.04YESYESYESYESYESYESYES0.0230.020.1380.080.0220.020.0040.000.0010.000.0400.020.0320.020.1170.090.0170.020.0080.000.0020.000.0490.020.4200.159.9728.970.0030.000.0010.000.0050.000.1430.300.4040.1410.0849.020.0030.000.0020.000.0040.000.1800.257680.9117680.911768Observations 0.915Adjusted R2Notes: Importer and exporter fixed effects included in all regressions.

In the present case, it is conceivable that the high risk ofmalaria in the South has led to acceptance of slavery by the local elite and maytherefore constitute a deep reason for the conflict. It may also affect contemporaneous trade flows through its lasting effect on institutions. So, we include themalaria risk index in 1860 from Hong 2007. We find neither a significant effecton trade nor does historical climate explain away the border. In the last column,we include all historical controls simultaneously in our model. All in all, we findthat the border reduces trade by 20.9 percent,34 even when we include variablescapturing the historical determinants of the Secession.35B.Including the West From the previous analysis, one cannot conclude that the Secession has causedthe observed border effect in contemporaneous trade data. Including historicalvariables that relate to the deep reasons for the Civil War goes some way in dealing with reverse causation. However, it fails to account for unobserved shocksthat both make the odds for Secession and todays bilateral trade flows larger.Unfortunately, no instrument is readytouse in an IV approach.One way to nudge the analysis closer to identifying a causal effect consists inseparating the whole of the US including the West into states that underwenta treatment by the Secession and states that were not affected by these historical events. We separate the states into three groups the North, the South, andthe West , still excluding border states, the District of Columbia, Alaska and Hawaii.36 The border dummy is unity for states that found themselves on opposite sides of the Civil War and zero for all other pairs of states. Adding the West adds a control set of state pairs that are characterized by their absence ofa past shaped by the Civil War.34100 exp0.235 1.35We have also experimented with direct measures for the historical transportation systemdifferences or networks of railroad miles per 100 square miles of land area after the Civil Warin 1870. The result is robust to the inclusion of the historical transportation system.36West includes all US states that were not assigned to the North, the South or the borderstates in Table 1, excluding the District of Columbia, Alaska and Hawaii.30FELBERMAYR AND GROSCHLTABLE 9Additionally Including the West, 1993Dependent Variable: ln bilateral exports between i and j relative to states GDPs Data:Specification:Aggregated Commodity OLS with MR Terms Chen 2004 FEFixed Effects21345Border Dummyij0.0730.040.1190.040.1980.03South South Dummyij North North Dummyij West West Dummyij 0.2400.070.2760.910.0360.090.2420.090.3750.040.2320.08ln Distanceij0.358 0.358 0.6900.6110.1630.050.050.040.040.03YES1,7390.851Additional Controls Observations Adjusted R2Notes: Constant, fixed effects, MR terms and controls not reported.

All models include additional contemporaneouscontrols.37 In columns 1, 3 and 5, we find for the fixed effects, the OLSwith MR terms, and the pooled commodity FE regression a significant tradeimpeding effect of the Secession treatment. The effect ranges between 7 and 18 percent. In addition, we again find in column 2 that the South trades moreamongst each other while the effect on the North is positive but insignificant.There seems not to be any particular trade effect within Western states. Thepicture looks different when we directly control for multilateral resistance incolumn 4. In this setup, all regions trade significantly more among themselvesthan with states of the other regions.3837Historical controls are not available for most of the Western states before the war, as thesewere only Territories in 1860.38Results are similar for the other years and can be found in Table A10 in the Web Appendix.TRADE AND THE AMERICAN SECESSION31V. Civil War at 150: Still Relevant, Still Divisive The former border between the Union and the Confederation is still relevant today: The defunct border represents a trade barrier that lowers trade between USstates by on average 7 to 20 percent. In a million placebo estimations, we findsupportive evidence that the magnitude of this border effect is unique. The result is robust to using alternative waves of the Commodity Flow Survey, to different econometric methods, or to the inclusion of Western states or the rest of theworld. It cannot be substantially attenuated, let alone eliminated, by adding avast array of contemporaneous and historical variables that correlate both withthe border dummy and, potentially, also with bilateral trade.The great Mississippi novelist and poet William Faulkner famously writes The past is never dead. Its not even past. Requiem for a Nun, 1951. Thisholds true for the Secession that tore the US apart 150 years ago, even when thejudgment is based on bilateral trade data and econometric analysis: Trade between the former Confederation and the former Union is about 14.5 percentsmaller on average than within the alliance. A number of additional resultsseem important: First, the effect of the long defunct border on todays tradeis not attributable to the legacy of slavery alone. It becomes weaker if not the Secession but the status of slave states is the criterion for belonging to one ofthe two groups. Second, the border effect is not merely a NorthSouth effect.When the border is redefined to reflect whether two states have been on opposing sides in the Civil War, it remains significantly negative. Third, the tradeinhibiting force of the former border has to do with the degree of differentiationof products: the higher, the stronger. This suggests that the channel throughwhich the border still matters may be through cultural affinity or trust.32FELBERMAYR AND GROSCHLReferences Acemoglu, Daron, Simon Johnson, and James A.
