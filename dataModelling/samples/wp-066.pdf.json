Abstract This paper analyzes the impact that terms of trade TOT are likely to have on the growth of the Peoples Republic of Chinas PRC neighboring countries. Two scenarios employing a dynamic computable general equilibrium framework are considered: i a convergence scenario, where historical trends are projected; and ii a baseline scenario, where technological progress in the PRC is placed in line with that of the United States US. The results show that the PRCs technological convergence leads to increased world prices for mining products, and lower world prices for manufactures, especially those exported extensively by the PRC. On the whole, however, the effects on the growth and TOT of the PRCs neighboring countries are relatively small. The modelling framework used in this study explicitly captures the various offsetting effects that dampen the impact on TOT and contribute to the small impact on growth. In addition, the additional capital required to finance the PRCs growth comes predominantly from domestic savings, placing little pressure on the global supply of capital. Thus, an awakening PRC is unlikely to make a dramatic entrance despite the countrys overall positive impact on the region although there is nothing to fear, there is also only little to gain. Keywords: computable general equilibrium, multicountry models, Peoples Republic of China, terms of trade JEL Classification: F17, F47, C68 The Awakening Chinese Economy: Macro and Terms of Trade Impacts 01 on 10 Major AsiaPacific Countries Introduction 1. The Peoples Republic of Chinas PRC economy is now the biggest in Asia. As its role increases, its impact on neighboring economies is also likely to increase. Therefore, the issue as to whether Asia is a locomotive for growth dependsto some degreeon how the PRC grows and how this growth affects the region. This paper analyzes the impact of an awakening PRC on the terms of trade TOT and growth of its neighbors. This paper focuses on TOT because a number of studies 1 have already examined growth spillovers.2 Issues associated with a countrys TOT have been a longstanding concern in development economics. In the 1950s and 1960s, the concern was about deteriorating primary commodity prices relative to manufactured goods, which harmed developing countries Prebisch 1950; Singer 1950. In the 1970s, the concern shifted to relative prices within manufactured goods. Since manufactured exports from developing countries typically have a lower technological content, the concern was that their prices would fall relative to the prices of exports from developed countries Singer 1971; Wood 1997; Maizels, Palaskas, and Crowe 1998. Since the mid1990s, the impact of an awakening PRC on the world has become a prominent topic in economic discussions. The PRC became a net importer of crude oil in the early 1990s. Since then it has relied heavily on energy from overseas, importing onethird of its consumption of crude oil in recent years. The rapid growth of its manufacturing industries also brought about increased demand for primary commodities such as iron ore and base metal products. The PRCs increasing demand for energy and primary inputs, as well as the rapid growth of its manufactured exports, has raised concerns about the impact of TOT on the growth of both developing and developed countries. To analyze the impact of the PRCs rapid development on the growth and TOT of its neighboring countries, a global dynamic computable general equilibrium CGE model that assesses 11 countries 3 individually and the rest of the world ROW collectively is used. The advantage of using a CGE framework is that it represents in detail the structures of the economies under review. With the rapid globalization of the past 3 decades, the links between the worlds economies have become more sophisticated, thereby increasing the complexity of analyzing TOT issues in particular. For example, if the PRCs demand for energy contributes to higher energy prices, then energy exporters TOT are likely to enjoy a favorable change, while energy importers TOT may deteriorate. The same would apply to primary products. Higher energy and commodity prices could lead to higher prices for manufactured goods as well, however, and these 1 See, for instance, Eichengreen, Rhee, and Tong 2004; Fujiwara, Otsu, and Saito 2008; Mc Kibbin and Woo 2003; Mai, Horridge, and Perkins 2003; Phelps 2004; and Sachs and Woo 2003. Exceptions include Kaplinsky 2006 and Phelps 2004, although neither of these two studies uses a multicountry modeling approach. The nine largest Asian countries PRC, India, Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand plus Australia and the United States US. 2 3 2 Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 66 effects need to be considered. It follows that the effects of the PRCs increasing demand for energy and primary products on the TOT of its neighboring countries will depend to a large degree on the economic structures of these economies. The structural details contained within the CGE model used in this paper accommodate the sophisticated nature of the issues at hand. The paper is organized into six sections. Section 2 discusses the methodology and data. Section 3 introduces how the PRCs technological convergence with developed countries is simulated. The effects of the PRCs convergence on neighboring countries are presented in Sections 4 and 5, with Section 4 analyzing the TOT effects and Section 5 assessing income and industry effects, as well as the results of sensitivity tests. A final section concludes. 2. Methodology and Data The PRCs increasing demand for energy and primary inputs is placed in the context of its convergence in per capita income with developed countries, achieved through technological progress. Improved technological progress underlies rapid economic growth in the PRC, and hence rapid growth in Chinese demand for energy and other primary inputs. Historical simulation was conducted to estimate the degree to which the PRC had to catch up with technological developments during 19972005. The purpose of the historical simulation is to calibrate the model with historical data, and to estimate quantitatively the PRCs technological progress relative to developed countries. The estimated speed of technological progress during the historical period is then used to simulate the effects of the PRCs technological convergence with developed countries, and to analyze the effects of the convergence on the PRC and its neighboring countries from 1999 to 2010. Finally, the robustness of the analysis was tested by supplementing the simulation of the PRCs convergence in technology with two other simulations: i a change in user preferences toward imported goods, especially manufactured goods that affect prices of manufactured exports; and ii an alternative scenario of the PRCs energy efficiency that affects its demand for energy and therefore world prices for energy products. The simulations were conducted using the MONASH MultiCountry MMC model. The MMC model is a global dynamic CGE model of 11 countries and the ROW. The model is described in detail in Mai 2004. 2.1 Historical Simulation The most important data for this analysis has been unobservedtechnological convergence. Historical simulation operates in reverse fashion to standard policy simulation. In a standard policy simulation, quantities and prices of production outputs and inputs, consumption, and international trade are typical endogenous variables, while production technology and consumer preferences are typical exogenous variables. In these simulations, the model is informed of a change in a technology or policy variable such as a deterioration in agricultural productivity or a tariff cut, and the model The Awakening Chinese Economy: Macro and Terms of Trade Impacts 03 on 10 Major AsiaPacific Countries Data sources and Related Issues calculates the resulting changes to gross domestic product GDP, consumption, output, employment, and other endogenous variables. In a historical simulation, the model operates in a reverse fashionwith GDP, production, consumption, and international trade as the exogenous variables, and the corresponding technical and preference change variables such as multifactor productivity as the endogenous variables. The model is informed of changes in GDP, consumption, investment, and other observed variables during a historical period. It can then impute the necessary changes in technology and preferences.4 2.2 The main sources of data for the macroeconomic variables are World Development Indicators published by the World Bank and UNSTATS published by the United Nations. These two sources are supplemented by country sources, such as the PRC National Statistical Bureau, the Singapore Department of Statistics, and the US Bureau of Economic Analysis see the list of statistical references at the end of this paper. The GTAP version 5 database Dimaranan and Mc Dougall 2002 is the main source of inputoutput and international trade data for the MMC model. Table 2.1 presents the growth rates of key macroeconomic variables during 19972005 for each country in the model. The data from various sources have been adjusted to be consistent with each other and with the model database for 1997. The table shows that the PRC enjoyed high GDP growth of about 9% per year from 1997 to 2005. Within gross national expenditure GNE, real investment or gross fixed capital formation grew much faster than real private and government consumption, indicating a high savings rate in the PRC. Both export and import volumes grew at doubledigit rates, much faster than real GDP and GNE. The volume of exports grew faster than the volume of imports, contributing to the PRCs current account surplus during the period. 2.3 The PRCs Technological Progress During 19972005 Table 2.2 summarizes employment and output data for the PRC and the US. It also shows estimates of technological progress during 19972005, based on results from the historical simulation.5 The table shows that the PRCs total primaryfactoraugmented productivity grew rapidly during this period. At the aggregate level, the PRCs total primaryfactoraugmented productivity grew by 4.4% per year during 19972005, much faster than the 1.3% annual growth rate for the US. By industry, technological progress for all sectors was faster in the PRC than in the US, except for agriculture and communications. 4 The historical simulation technique using a CGE model is described in detail in Dixon and Rimmer 2002. Applications to trade that use this technique to estimate technology and preference changes include Dixon, Menon, and Rimmer 2000; and Mai, Horridge, and Perkins 2003. In this study, technological progress is defined as an improvement in total primaryfactoraugmented productivity, which is defined as an increase in output relative to a weighted average of all primaryfactor inputs. 5 4 Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 66 From the estimations, the mining sector in the PRC substantially improved. The historical simulation covers a period during which the PRC overhauled its oil and gas industry to create vertically integrated oil giants that can compete with international rivals Yan 1998; Mai 2002. Because of reforms, however, employment in the mining industry significantly fell during the period. 3. The PRCs Technological Convergence This section explains how the PRCs technological convergence with developed countries was simulated, as well as the effects of the convergence on the PRCs real GDP, GNP, and TOT. 3.1 Simulating the PRCs Convergence The historical simulation outlined in Section 2 represents a real scenario from 19972005, in which the PRC continued its convergence in technology with developed countriesa journey that began in 1978. To analyze the effects of the technological convergence during 19972005, the real scenario was compared with a baseline in which the PRC does not catch up technologically. To obtain this baseline, it was assumed that, on average, the PRCs productivity improves in line with that of the US, as estimated for 19972005. In the baseline, the PRCs national productivity was assumed to be growing at 1.3% that of the US, while the sectoral pattern of productivity improvement estimated in the historical simulation was maintained. In simulating the PRCs convergence, total average annual productivity growth was assumed to be 3.1%, and broken down as follows: 2.4% productivity growth for agriculture, 5.0% for mining, 3.7% for manufacturing, and 2.7% for services. The real scenario is extended to 2010 through a forecast simulation to see the effects in the longterm. The same forecast simulation from 20052010 has been done for the economies in the model. In this simulation, it was assumed that the PRC and the US continued their growth trend in 19972005. The trend rates of growth during 20052010 for countries affected by the 199798 Asian financial crisis were assumed to resemble those of 19902005 Table 3.1. The real scenario, consisting of the historical simulation for 19972005 and the forecast simulation for 20052010, forms the convergence scenario. By removing the annual technological progress for 20002010, the baseline is deriveda scenario where the PRC does not catch up with developed countries. Figure 3.1 shows that the effects of the convergence are measured by the difference between the convergence scenario and the baseline, or the deviations of economic variables from their baseline levels in 2010. Table 3.2 presents a summary of the growth trend for key macroeconomic variables in the baseline scenario for the economies in the model. The Awakening Chinese Economy: Macro and Terms of Trade Impacts 05 on 10 Major AsiaPacific Countries 3.2 Effects of the Convergence on the PRCs Real GDP and GNP During 19972005, the PRCs average annual growth rate in real GDP was 8.9%. During the forecast period of 20052010, it was assumed that the PRC continued its historical growth trend of 8.9% per year. Table 3.2 shows that without technological convergence, the PRCs real GDP would grow at a rate of only 4.8% per year, much lower than the convergence rate of 8.9%. Figure 3.2 illustrates the different growth path the PRC would take with and without the technological convergence. With technological convergence, the PRCs GDP is likely to be over 50% higher in 2010 Table 3.3. In a longrun simulation such as this, it is assumed that aggregate employment L is determined by demographic factors and thus is not affected by the extra technical progress in the PRC. Accordingly, aggregate employment does not deviate from its baseline value,6 and so does not contribute to the positive deviation in real GDP Figure 3.3. A positive deviation in capital stock, however, does contribute to the positive deviation in real GDP. The positive deviation in capital stock can be explained by the following capital market equilibrium condition: 1 The technical progress boosts the average capital rental Q, reduces production costs and thus Pg, and thereby generates increases in QPg. However, this effect is weak relative to the increase in 1A, the technological progress. This also implies an increase in KL. It is assumed that technical progress in the PRC does not affect aggregate employment L. Thus, K must increase. Table 3.3 shows that the 44.2% increase in real GNP is smaller than that of real GDP following the PRCs convergence. This is mainly due to two factors. The first relates to the increase in capital income that partly underlies the increased GDP that accrues to foreigners, while the second relates to the decline in the TOT. All else being equal, deterioration in the TOT reduces the price of output, which includes exports but not imports, relative to the price of expenditure, which includes imports but not exports. Reductions in the price of output or GDP relative to the price of expenditure or GNE, in most cases, cause real GDP to increase relative to real GNP. 3.4 Effects of the Convergence on the PRCs Terms Of Trade The simulation results show that the PRCs TOT declines significantly as a result of the technological convergence Figure 3.4. Starting from the same level in 1999, the PRCs TOT is about 10% lower by 2010 with the technological convergence than without it. In the baseline without the PRCs convergence, the PRCs TOT grows at an average 6 Although aggregate employment is exogenous, employment by industries is endogenous as labor is mobile between industries andor sectors within the PRC. 1LKFAPQkg6 Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 66 annual rate of 0.7% from 1999 to 2010. With technological convergence, the PRCs TOT declines at an average annual rate of 0.3% during the same period. Figure 3.5 shows that the decline in the PRCs TOT is caused by a strong decline in its export price index, combined with a moderate increase in its import price index. More specifically, in 2010, the 10% decline in the TOT is caused by a decline in the export price index of nearly 9% and an increase in the import price index of nearly 2% Table 3.4. The main factor that influences the PRCs export prices is the strong technological progress in the convergence scenario relative to the baseline. The improvement in the total primaryfactoraugmented productivity in the PRC reduces production costs, leading to reduced output and export prices. The decline in the export price index for agriculture products is less than that for manufactured goods Table 3.4. This is because improvement of productivity in the agriculture sector is estimated to be slower than that in the manufacturing sector in the historical simulation. Furthermore, the agricultural sector uses land as a primaryfactor input. In these simulations, additional technological progress was not allowed to affect the amount of land available for producers. Fixing the availability of land limits the agricultural sectors ability to reduce costs. Although the improvement of productivity in the mining sector was larger than that in the manufacturing sector, the sectors production is significantly limited by the availability of resources, especially with regard to the oil industry. In the simulation, it was assumed that the PRCs technological convergence had little influence on its oil production. Even though the convergence brings about a higher demand for oil, the PRCs oil production continues its resourcelimited growth of 2% per year.7 This means that the PRCs oil price rises with the strong increase in demand caused by the technological convergence. The decrease in the export price index for the mining sector is due to a decline in the export price for coal. Continuing its historical trend, coal becomes dominant in the PRCs mining exports by 2010 in the baseline Table 3.4. With technological convergence, the PRCs export price for coal is lower than in the case of no technological progress. The limited availability of resources for coal is less of a constraint in the PRC than that for oil and gas. The shares of mining and agricultural products in the PRCs total exports, however, are insignificant compared with that of manufactured goods. Manufactured goods comprise the bulk of the PRCs total exports.8 The 9percentagepoint fall in the export price index is therefore mainly attributable to the fall in the export price index for manufactures Table 3.4. 7 The PRCs selfsufficiency policy meant that the country reached its domesticresource limit before it turned to imports on a large scale in the early 1990s. The service exports presented in Table 3.4 include only crossborder transactions, or the first two modes of trade in services. The bulk of the services trade involves movement of people and capital across bordersthe third and forth modes of service trade, which are not explicitly discussed in this study. Trade in services therefore appears to be insignificant compared to the merchandise trade in Table 3.4. 8 The Awakening Chinese Economy: Macro and Terms of Trade Impacts 07 on 10 Major AsiaPacific Countries The 2percentagepoint rise in the PRCs import price index is mainly attributable to large increases in the prices for agricultural and mining products. As a result of the PRCs convergence, the import price index for manufactured goods rises only slightly by about 0.5%. The import price index of agriculture rises significantly by 4%, and mining rises by 14%. This is because the PRCs convergence leads to increased demand for imported energy and primary inputs such as oil, iron ore, wool, and cotton. Oil, in particular, registers the largest rise in the import price as a result of the PRCs technological convergence. In the simulation, the PRCs convergence is assumed not to have a significant impact on oil production in the PRC and in other countries. Oil production is assumed to be mainly determined by supplyside factors such as resource constraints in the PRC and monopolistic production behavior in the Middle East. 3.5 Effects of Convergence on the PRCs Economic Structure As a result of the technological convergence, the PRCs exports increase by about 46% and imports by about 45% relative to their respective baseline levels in 2010. Imports and exports of all commodities and services rise relative to their baseline levels Table 3.5. On the export side, the increase in manufactured exports is larger than those in agricultural and mining exports. By contrast, the increase in manufactured imports is smaller than those in agricultural and mining imports. The deviation from the baseline of valueadded by industries shows a similar pattern to that of the export volumes. Table 3.5 shows that, following the technological convergence, valueadded in all sectors expands. However, valueadded of the manufacturing and services sectors rise more than that of the agricultural and mining sectors. In the convergence scenario, the PRCs productivity is assumed to improve in all sectors relative to the baseline. The improvement in the agricultural sector is, however, slower than that in the manufacturing and services sectors. Furthermore, the agricultural sector has land as a fixed factor, limiting its scope to expand production. Although the mining sector experiences the largest increase in productivity, its production is significantly limited by resource constraints, as discussed in Section 3.3. Thus, technological convergence causes the PRC to increase its specialization in manufacturing. Due to resource constraints, the PRC becomes more dependent on imports for agricultural and mining products. 4. Terms of Trade Effects of the PRCs Convergence on Neighboring Countries In Section 3, the effects of the PRCs rapid economic growth from 1999 to 2010 is simulated, and stimulated by its technological convergence. As a result, the prices of agricultural and mining products in the PRC rise relative to their levels without convergence, while the price of manufactures fall relative to their noconvergence levels. Japan 8 Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 66 Consequently, the PRC, as a net importer of agricultural and mining products, and a net exporter of manufactures, experiences a significant fall in its TOT. This section analyzes the effects of PRCs technological convergence on the TOT of neighboring countries. Table 4.1 shows that, as a result of the PRCs technological convergence, the TOT of countries rich in resourcessuch as Australia, Indonesia, and the ROWimprove. The TOT for the US also improves. India, having an endowment and production pattern similar to that of the PRC, suffers the second largest deterioration in its TOT after the PRC. The magnitude of the TOT effects, however, is generally small for neighboring countries because the PRCs convergence has both positive and negative influences on export and import price indexes. The outcome for neighboring countries is examined in more detail. 4.1 The PRCs technological convergence has a small negative impact on Japans TOT. The deviation of Japans TOT from its baseline level in 2010 is 0.8%, or about 14 times less than that for the PRC Table 4.1. On the export side, the deviation from the baseline of the export price index is 0.1%. This is due to the offsetting effects caused by a fall negative deviation from baseline in the export price index for manufactures and a rise positive deviation from baseline in the export price index for services third column of Table 4.2. Japans export price index for services rises because the services trade in the model includes transport and insurance margins demanded by international trade transactions. With the PRC catching up in technology, total world trade expands, leading to increased demand for transportation and insurance services. With the very small deviation in the export price index, the negative deviation of Japans TOT is mainly attributable to a positive deviation in the imports price index of 0.9%. The positive deviation in Japans import price index, in turn, is caused by a significant rise in import prices for agricultural and mining products. In particular, the price index of Japans mining imports rises by 11% due to the PRCs catchingup column b of Table 4.3. However, the effects on Japans import price index of the rise in prices for mining imports are largely offset by the fall in prices for manufactured imports column c of Table 4.3. Prices for manufactured imports fall mainly due to a fall in the price of manufactured imports from the PRC. Although the rise in prices of mining imports exceeds in absolute terms the fall in prices of manufactured imports, manufactured imports have a dominant share in Japans total imports column a of Table 4.3. Thus, overall, Japans import price index rises moderately, leading to a small fall in the TOT. The Awakening Chinese Economy: Macro and Terms of Trade Impacts 09 on 10 Major AsiaPacific Countries index The Republic of Korea for manufactures rises because 4.2 The Republic of Korea Korea also experiences a small negative deviation in its TOT due to the PRCs technological convergence. The deviation in Koreas TOT from baseline in 2010 is 0.7%, similar to that for Japan. However, both Koreas import and export price indexes increase more than those for Japan Table 4.1. Although the PRCs convergence tends to bring down the worldwide price for manufactures, Koreas export price its manufactured exports are oilintensive. As the PRCs convergence pushes up prices for mining products especially crude oil, the prices for petroleum and coal products that use mining products as the main intermediate input also rise significantly. Since petroleum products comprise a significant share of Koreas total exports compared with Japan, this leads to a small rise in Koreas export price index for manufactures. The import price index for manufactures falls less in Korea than in Japan because Korea imports a smaller proportion of manufactures from the PRC than Japan does Figure 4.1. The PRCs export price index for manufactures falls significantly as it catches up with developed countries in production technology. Consequently, Japan, importing a larger proportion of manufactures from the PRC, experiences a larger fall in its import price for manufactures. 4.3 The PRCs convergence leads to an overall fall in export prices and to a rise in import prices in India. As a result, Indias TOT falls relative to its value in the baseline by 3.5% in 2010. This is a larger change than those simulated for other neighboring countries of the PRC Table 4.1. On the import side, the import price index for mining rises in India as in Japan and Korea. However, unlike for Japan and Korea, the rise in the import price index for mining is not offset by a fall in the import price index for manufactures third column, Table 4.5. In Indias case, two factors contribute to a rise in the import price index for manufactures: a significant share of petroleum and coal products in total imports, and a small share of manufactured imports from the PRC in total manufactured imports. India has the largest share of petroleum and coal products in total imports among the nine economies that are analyzed in detail in this paper. The large rise in the import price for petroleum and coal products following the PRCs convergence therefore places significant upward pressure on Indias import price index for manufactured goods. Furthermore, India imports less manufactured goods from the PRC than the other economies presented in Figure 4.1. The large fall in the price of manufactured imports from the PRC is therefore not sufficient to offset the upward pressure on Indias import price index for manufactured goods discussed earlier. On the export side, the downward pressure that the PRCs convergence places on the export price index for manufactured goods plays a more significant role for India than for India Indonesia 10 Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 66 the other countries analyzed in this paper. This is because Indias exports concentrate on laborintensive manufactures, such as clothing and other wearing apparel. As a result of the PRCs convergence, these products have larger price declines than do the capitalintensive ones, such as motor vehicles and nonferrous metals Table 4.6. To summarize, Indias TOT worsens mainly due to the following characteristics in its trade structure: i a significant share of mining products in total imports, ii a large share of petroleum and coal products in total imports, iii a small share of manufactured imports from the PRC in total manufactured imports, and iv a concentration of laborintensive manufactures in its total exports. 4.4 The story is quite different for Indonesia. As a result of the PRCs convergence, Indonesias TOT improves by 2.8% in 2010 Table 4.1. Table 4.7 shows that the improvement in TOT for Indonesia is mainly attributable to a large rise in its export price index. Indonesias export price index rises by 4.4% in 2010, much more than the rise in its import price index of 1.6% Table 4.7. For Indonesia, the rise in the export price index of mining products following the PRCs convergence plays a significant role. Compared with other countries, Indonesia has a significant share of mining products in its total exports. 4.5 Malaysia The simulation results show that the PRCs convergence has little impact on Malaysias TOT, which is down 0.1% in 2010 Table 4.1. For Malaysia, changes are small to both the export 0.2% and import 0.1% price indexes Table 4.8. On the export side, electronic equipment comprises the dominant share in Malaysias total exports. Following the PRCs convergence, prices for electronic equipment fall significantly. Malaysias export price index for manufactures also falls as a result Table 4.8. On the other hand, mining products comprise a significant share of total exports in Malaysiaalthough not as large as in Indonesia. As a result, the effects of the rise in the export price indexes for agriculture, mining, and services almost completely offset the effects of the fall in the export price index for manufactures. Thus, the PRCs convergence leads to a very small change in Malaysias export price index. Similarly, on the import side, a small fall in the import price index for manufactures combined with a dominant share of manufactures in total imports has a negative effect on Malaysias import price index. However, this negative effect is almost completely offset by the effect of the rise in the import price indexes for agriculture, mining, and services Table 4.8. The Awakening Chinese Economy: Macro and Terms of Trade Impacts 011 on 10 Major AsiaPacific Countries 4.6 Singapore The PRCs convergence has little impact on Singapores TOT Table 4.1, with both the export and import price indexes rising relative to baseline values by similar amounts Table 4.9. Petroleum and coal products have a significant share in Singapores manufactured exports Table 4.9. The large rise in the export prices for petroleum and coal products therefore places upward pressure on Singapores export price index for manufactures. This upward pressure is, however, largely offset by a fall in export price for electronic equipment. The result is a small rise in the export price index for manufactures. The small rise in the export price index for manufactures reinforces the rise in the export price for services,9 leading to an increase in Singapores overall export price index. On the import side, the downward pressure placed on the import price index for manufactures by the fall in the import price for electronic equipment more than offsets the upward pressure caused by the rise in import prices for petroleum and coal products. This leads to a small fall in the import price index for manufactures Table 4.9. The fall in the import price index for manufactures offsets the effects of a large rise in the import price index for mining products, leading to only a small rise in the overall import price index for Singapore. To summarize, the positive factors that have a strong influence on Singapores TOT are i a significant share of petroleum and coal products in total exports combined with a large rise in the export price index for these products, ii a dominant share of electronic equipment in total imports combined with a fall in the import price index for these products, and iii a large share of services in total exports combined with a rise in the export price index for services. The negative factors that have a strong influence on Singapores TOT are i a significant share of mining products in total imports combined with a large rise in the import price index for these products, ii a significant share of petroleum and coal products in total imports combined with a large rise in the import price index for these products, and iii a dominant share of electronic equipment in total exports combined with a fall in the export price for these products. These offsetting factors of more or less equal strength result in a small overall effect of the PRCs convergence on Singapores TOT. 4.7. Thailand As a result of the PRCs convergence, Thailands TOT falls relative to its baseline value by 1.5% in 2010 Table 4.1. The export price index falls by a relatively small 0.3%, while the import price index rises by 1.2% in 2010 Table 4.10. 9 As discussed, the PRCs convergence leads to increased world trade Table 5.1 that, in turn, leads to increased demand for international trade margins such as transport and insurance services. The export price index for services therefore rises. 12 Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 66 For Thailand, a dominant share of electronic equipment and other machinery and equipment in total exports combined with a fall in the export prices for these products leads to a fall in the export price index for manufactures. This negative effect on Thailands export price index is largely offset by the effect of a rise in the export price index for services. The result is a very small decline in the overall export price index for Thailand Table 4.10. Similarly, on the import side, a dominant share of electronic equipment and other machinery and equipment in total imports combined with a fall in the import prices for these products leads to a fall in the import price index for manufactures. This negative effect on Thailands import price index offsets partially the effect of a large rise in the import price index for mining products. The result is a moderate rise in the import price index of 1.2%. 4.8 Philippines The simulation results show that the PRCs convergence results in a fall of 0.9% in the Philippines TOT Table 4.1. The fall in TOT is attributable to a rise in the import price index of 0.9% Table 4.11, with the export price index changing little. On the export side, a dominant share of electronic equipment in total exports combined with a fall in the export prices for these products leads to a fall in the export price index for manufactures. This negative effect on the Philippines export price index is offset by the effect of a rise in the export price index for services Table 4.11. On the import side, a dominant share of electronic equipment in total imports combined with a fall in the import prices for these products leads to a fall in the import price index for manufactures. This negative effect on the Philippines import price index partially offsets the effect of a large rise in the import price index for mining products. The result is a rise in the import price index of 0.9%. To summarize, the two positive factors that have a strong influence on the Philippines TOT are i a dominant share of electronic equipment in total imports combined with a fall in the import price for these products, and ii a rise in the export price index for services. The two negative factors that have a strong influence on the Philippines TOT are i a dominant share of electronic equipment in total exports combined with a fall in the export price for these products, and ii a large rise in the import price index for mining products. 5. The Growth Effects of the PRCs Convergence on Neighboring Countries 5.1 Effects on Export Volumes and Production Mix The PRCs convergence leads to small changes in the total export volumes of its neighboring countries Table 5.1. While the neighboring countries export less to their The Awakening Chinese Economy: Macro and Terms of Trade Impacts 013 on 10 Major AsiaPacific Countries their total export volumes. traditional markets such as the US, Japan, and the ROW, they export more to the PRC Table 5.2. Table 5.2 shows that in the US, Japan, and the ROW markets, the PRCs convergence leads to a large increase in imports from the PRC, while imports from all other countries andor regions fall. However, for the PRCs neighboring countries, this negative impact on their exports is greatly softened by a large increase in their exports to the PRC. For Korea and Japan, which send a larger proportion of their exports to the PRC than other countries presented in Figure 5.1, the fall in their exports to other markets is more than compensated for by the increase in their exports to the PRC, leading to an increase in In terms of commodity composition, exports of manufactures fall for most of the PRCs neighboring countries, except Korea and Japan. Exports of agricultural and mining products and services, on the other hand, rise as a result of the PRCs convergence Table 5.1. Again, the decline in the export of manufactures is due to declining exports of these products to nonPRC markets. The neighboring countries exports of manufactures to the PRC market increase as a result of the convergence. Indeed, the PRCs convergence not only leads to a large increase in its export of manufactures, convergence also leads to a large increase in its import of manufactures, primarily electronic equipment, other machinery and equipment, and chemicalrubberplastic products. Table 5.3 shows that electronic equipment, other machinery and equipment, and chemicalrubberplastic products comprise large shares of both the PRCs total exports and imports. For these products, the PRC is part of a production network. For example, the production in the PRC of electronic equipment requires imports of electronic equipment from its neighboring countries as intermediate inputs. The technological convergence intensifies the PRCs role in these networks. The convergence leads to a large increase in the neighboring countries exports imports of electronic equipment, other machinery and equipment, and chemicalrubberplastic products to from the PRC; on the other hand, the neighboring countries total exports imports of these products to the world either fall or increase at slower rates Table 5.3. Therefore, as a result of the PRCs convergence, the neighboring countries reduce their trade in such products with nonPRC partners and trade more with the PRC. Table 5.4 shows that for neighboring countries, the PRCs convergence leads to a pattern of change in the production mix similar to that for exports. Other than a few exceptions, valueadded for manufactures contract, while that for the primary and services sectors expand for the neighboring countries. 5.2 Why are the GDP Effects Small? The impact of the PRCs convergence on the real GDP of neighboring countries is mixed, but overall very smallless than one percentage point for all but India. Indias real GDP 14 Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 66 decreases by about 1.0% as a result of the PRCs technological convergence Table 5.5. Output can expand only when there are increases in production factors employed an increase in L or K or improvement in productivity a reduction in A. In the simulation of the PRCs convergence, the following assumptions are made: i aggregate employment is determined by longrun factors, such as population growth and labor force participation rates, and therefore is exogenous in the simulation of the PRCs convergence in technology; and ii productivity of the neighboring countries is also exogenous. Thus, the changes in output mainly come from changes in capital stock employed. From the equilibrium condition in the capital market, or equation 1, with the L and A exogenous, changes in capital stock K are mainly determined by changes in rental price relative to output price QPg. QPg, in turn, is a function of the rate of return on capital and TOT.10 Table 5.5 shows that the PRCs convergence also leads to small changes in the neighboring countries rate of return on capital. This is because the PRC has a high savings rate, as is well known. Foreign capital accounts for a very small proportion of the PRCs total capital stock. When the PRC converges with developed countries in technology, the additional capital required to finance the increase in GDP comes mainly from domestic savings. The small changes in rates of return to capital and TOT lead to small changes in the QPg term, and thus to small changes in capital stock. As a result, the PRCs convergence leads to small changes in real GDP for the neighboring countries.11 It is natural to raise the question that if the PRC can finance its high growth out of domestic savings, why is it important for the PRC to open its economy to foreign investment? The answer lies in the spillover effects of foreign investment. Foreign investment brings about more advanced production technology as well as management skills. The key benefit of foreign investment is improvement in productivity as other players in the host industry catch up with the performance standards set by foreign investors Mai 2004; Menon 1998.12 The fact that domestic, rather than foreign, savings will fuel most of the PRCs future growth should also allay the fears of some of its 10 The terms QPg can be expanded to where P2 is asset price. The first term is rate of return on capital. The second term is a function of TOT because P2 includes import prices but not export prices, and Pg includes export prices but not import prices. 11 Changes in indirect taxes will also affect real GDP. That effect is small in this simulation and is therefore ignored in the discussion. It would be interesting to see how the simulation results would change if productivity in the PRC and its neighboring countries responded endogenously to flows of FDI. While there are many theories about why FDI would improve productivity, empirical estimates of such productivity improvement are scarce. Further modelling research on this issue is important, but beyond the scope of this paper. 12 22g QPPPThe Awakening Chinese Economy: Macro and Terms of Trade Impacts 015 on 10 Major AsiaPacific Countries neighbors that compete for similar types of foreign direct investment FDI. Some of the member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ASEAN, in particular, have expressed concern that the PRCs growth has occurred at the expense of FDI flowing into their home countries. The results presented here suggest that even if this were true in the past, it is unlikely to be the case in the future. 5.3 Effects on GNP The effects of the PRCs convergence on real GNP in neighboring countries are presented in the first row of Table 5.5. For the PRC, the convergence leads to a much smaller increase in real GNP than in real GDP. For the neighboring countries, the results vary. The difference between the effects on real GDP and GNP can be largely explained by each countrys respective TOT. As discussed earlier, an improvement deterioration in the TOT increases reduces the price of output, which includes exports but not imports, relative to the price of expenditure, which includes imports but not exports. Increases in the price of output or GDP relative to the price of expenditure or GNE will, in most cases, cause real GNP to increase relative to real GDP. Such is the case for the PRC and most of the countries under review. Another factor that explains the difference between real GDP and GNP is net income from abroad. As a result of the PRCs convergence, the PRCs rental price for capital rises significantly, while rental prices for capital in other countries either fall slightly or remain largely unchanged. Those countries that hold a larger proportion of their outward investment stock in the PRC therefore benefit more from its convergence. For Singapore, real GNP rises notably more than real GDP, even though Singapores TOT declines as a result of the PRCs convergence. This is because Singapore is among the 10 largest source countries for foreign investment in the PRC. Furthermore, Singapores outward stock of foreign investment is very large relative to its GDP. Finally, two sensitivity tests were conducted to check the robustness of the results. Changes of assumptions about user preferences in favor of imports and the PRCs energy efficiency did not affect the main findings to any significant degree. 6. Concluding Comments The PRCs rapid economic growth generates both positive and negative effects on the TOT of neighboring countries. Simulations using that technological convergence and the resulting rapid economic growth in the PRC leads to i an increase in the world price for energy and primary inputs; ii a decrease in the world price for manufactured goods; and iii expanded world trade and therefore an increase in the world price for services exports such as transportation and financial services. the MMC model show involving neighboring countries, 16 Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration No. 66 These changes in world prices have positive and negative effects on the TOT of neighboring countries, depending on each countrys respective economic structure Table 5.6. The historical simulation demonstrated that neighboring countries responded to the rapid growth of the PRC by expanding their trade and investment linkages with it e.g., the network of production for electronic and other goods in the region. This, in turn, strengthened the positive effects on their TOT, leading to an overall small improvement in the TOT, despite the increase in the world price for energy and primary inputs. The overall impact on exports of neighboring countries is also small. While the PRC replaced some of the neighboring countries exports in their traditional markets, in the process, the PRC itself became an important export destination for these neighboring countries. As part of production networks its convergence increases imports into the PRC of not only agricultural and mining products, but also manufactures and services. The impact of the PRCs convergence on the real GDP of its close neighbors is also small. There are two main reasons for this. The first is that the additional capital required to finance the increase in the PRCs real GDP comes mainly from domestic savings. Foreign capital constitutes a very small proportion of the PRCs total capital stock. While rapid growth in the PRC places significant pressure on the worlds supply of natural resources, it places little pressure on the global supply of capital. This should also allay the fears of some of its neighbors which compete for similar types of FDI e.g., ASEAN countries that future growth in the PRC may occur at the expense of FDI flowing into their countries. The second reason relates to the fact that any productivity improvements induced by an expansion in trade and investment flows have not been taken into account in this study. If this factor is taken into account, the PRCs convergence could have led to a larger positive impact on the real GDP of neighboring countries. The impact of the PRCs convergence on neighboring countries real GNPa better welfare measure than real GDPis small. There are also two reasons for this. The first is that the overall impact of the PRCs convergence on neighboring countries real GDP is small. The second is that the overall TOT impact on neighboring countries is also small. In summary, the macro and TOT effects of the PRC growth locomotive are positive, supporting the view that the PRCs growth presents more opportunities than risks. But almost all of these effects are small. If this appears counterintuitive, then it could be because the framework employed here takes into account the offsetting effects. Therefore, although an awakening PRC will have an overall positive impact on the region, its entrance is unlikely to be dramatic.

Using a multicountry model, they find that PRCs technological convergence raises the world prices for mining products and lowers those for manufactures. Overall, the effects are relatively small, however. Therefore, although an awakening PRC will have a positive impact on the region, it is unlikely to make a dramatic entrance.About the Asian Development Bank ADBs vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing member countries substantially reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the regions many successes, it remains home to twothirds of the worlds poor: 1.8 billion people who live on less than 2 a day, with 903 million struggling on less than 1.25 a day. ADB is committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.Based in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main instruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity investments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance.Asian Development Bank 6 ADB Avenue, Mandaluyong City 1550 Metro Manila, Philippineswww.adb.orgpoverty Publication Stock No. Printed in the Philippines", "filename": "wp-066.pdf", "person": ["Yin Hua Mai", "Mai, Yin Hua", "Philip Adams", "Adams, Philip", "Peter Dixon", "Dixon, Peter", "Jayant Menon", "Menon, Jayant"], "date": ["2010"]}
