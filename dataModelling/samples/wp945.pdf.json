Moreover, transport constraints reduce competition between agents situated in separated markets, which worsens market e ciency even further. Congestion is of particular importance for markets with negligible storage possibilities,such as wholesale electricity markets. Then demand and supply must be instantlybalanced and temporary congestion in the network can result in large local pricespikes. The same market can at times exhibit very little market power and, atother times, suer from the exercise of a great deal of market power. Borensteinet al.13 show that standard concentration measures such as the Hercid:133ndahlHirschman index HHI work poorly to assess the degree of competition in suchmarkets. Thus competition authorities who need to predict market prices undervarious counterfactuals cid:150what might happen if a merger or acquisition is acceptedor transport capacity is expanded, need more detailed analytical tools.We analyze the networkcid:146s incid:135uence on an oligopoly market where producerssell a homogeneous commodity. We assume that cid:133rms compete with supply functions and that each node of the radial network has a local demand shock. Theslope of the residual demand curve 1 is important in the calculation of a cid:133rmcid:146soptimal oer. However, this curve is uncertain due to the demand shocks. Thisuncertainty is characterized using Anderson and Philpottcid:146s 4 and Wilsoncid:146s 43market distribution function approach. We show that the optimal output of aproducer is proportional to its markup and the expected slope of the residualdemand curve that it is facing.2 Thus a more elastic residual demand results in amore competitive oer.We assume that transports along an arc of the network are costless, as longas it is uncongested. We say that two nodes are completely integrated when theyare connected via uncongested arcs. A node is always completely integrated withitself. The cid:135ow through arcs with a strictly binding transport capacity is cid:133xedon the margin. Thus on the margin, a cid:133rmcid:146s residual demand is only incid:135uencedby nodes that are completely integrated with the cid:133rmcid:146s node. For symmetricequilibria we cid:133nd it useful to decid:133ne a market integration factor, which equals theexpected number of nodes that are completely integrated with a node in the network. Firms can incid:135uence the market integration factor with their oer curves, soit is endogenous. We use our optimality conditions to solve for symmetric equilibria in twonode and star networks 3 with multidimensional uniformly distributeddemand shocks. In this case, the market integration factor is found to be constant for a given network with given transmission capacities and total productioncapacities. The factor does not depend on production costs nor on the number of 1The residual demand at a specicid:133c price is given by demand at that price less competitorscid:146sales as that price.2Note that the output of the cid:133rm incid:135uences congestion in the network, which in its turnincid:135uences its residual demand curve. Thus with the slope of residual demand we here mean theslope of residual demand conditional on a cid:133xed output.3There are no strategic producers in the center node of the star network. Thus the networkis symmetric from the producerscid:146perspective.2symmetric cid:133rms.We show that an equilibrium oer in a node of such a network isidentical to the equilibrium oer in an isolated node where the number of symmetric cid:133rms has been scaled by the market integration factor. Thus previous resultsfor symmetric SFE in single node networks 520242734 become applicable tosymmetric SFE in symmetric radial networks with transport constraints.We focus on characterising supply function equilibrium SFE in radial networks, but we also show how our optimality conditions can be generalized toconsider meshed networks with loop cid:135ows, although the resulting models do notsimplify as in the radial case. Moreover, we describe how our conditions can bemodicid:133ed to calculate SFE in networks with discriminatory pricing and Cournot Nash equilibrium in networks with uncertain demand. Normally nodes representa geographical location, and with transport we normally mean that the commodity is moved from one geographical location to another location. But nodes andtransports could be interpreted in a more general sense. For example, a node couldrepresent a point in time or a geographical location at a particular point in time.Moreover, storage at a geographical location can be represented by arcs that allowfor transports of the commodity to a later point in time. The transport capacityof such arcs would then correspond to the local storage capacity.The supply function equilibrium for single node markets was originally developed by Klemperer and Meyer 27. This equilibrium represents a generalized formof competition in oligopoly markets, inbetween the extremes of the Bertrand and Cournot equilibrium. The setting of the SFE is particularly wellsuited for marketswhere producers submit oer curves to a uniformprice auction before demand hasbeen realized, as in wholesale electricity markets 122024. This has also beenconcid:133rmed qualitatively and quantitatively in several empirical studies of biddingin electricity markets.4 But the SFE model is of more general interest. Klemperer and Meyer 27 argue that although most markets are not explicitly clearedby uniformprice auctions, cid:133rms typically face a uniform market price and theyneed predetermined decision rules for lowerlevel managers to deal with changingmarket conditions. Thus, in general, cid:133rms implicitly commit to supply functions.Vives 38 notes that competition in supply functions has also been used to modelbidding for government procurement contracts, management consulting and airlinepricing reservation systems.Klemperer and Meyercid:146s model has only one uncertain parameter, a demandshock. In equilibrium there is a one to one mapping between the price and shock.Thus each cid:133rm can choose its supply function such that its output is optimalfor every realized shock. As noted by Anderson et al 6, this expost optimality feature is di cult to translate into a network with multidimensional demandshocks. They investigate a twonode transmission network with both independentand correlated demand at the nodes. Anderson et al derive formulae to represent the market distribution function for a producer when its network becomes 4Empirical studies of the electricity market in Texas ERCOT show that oers of the twoto three largest cid:133rms in this market match Klemperer and Meyercid:146s cid:133rstorder condition 2536.Further empirical support is provided by Wolak 44 who vericid:133es that electricity producers in Australia choose their oers in order to maximize procid:133ts; at least observed data does not rejectthis hypotehesis.3interconnected to a previously separate grid under the assumption that the interconnection does not change competitorscid:146oers.By requiring that each cid:133rmcid:146s oer is optimal only in expectation, the recentpaper by Wilson 42 takes a dierent approach, which enables him to extend Klemperer and Meyercid:146s 27 model to consider the networkcid:146s incid:135uence on biddingstrategies.5 This exante optimality requirement is adopted in our paper, and soour work follows the same approach as 42. Wilson, however, does not provideany secondorder conditions in his paper, and so his analysis of SFE is missing afundamental component.Previous research has shown that secondorder conditions are often violated ina network with strategic producers. The reason is that transport constraints canintroduce nonsmoothness in a producercid:146s residual demand curve which becomesdiscontinuously less price sensitive when net imports to its market are congested.Thus, in a market where imports are nearly congested it will be procid:133table fora producer to withhold production in order to push the price above the nextbreakpoint in its residual demand curve. This type of deviation will often ruleout purestrategy Nash equilibria.6 Borenstein et al.14 for example rule out Cournot NE when the transport capacity between two symmetric markets is sufcid:133ciently small and demand is certain. Downward et al. 16 analyse existence of Cournot equilibria in general networks with transport constraints. Neuho et alcid:146s31 analysis of the northwestern European electricity market illustrates that nonexistence of Cournot NE is a problem also in practice. We verify that monotonicsolutions to our cid:133rstorder conditions are Supply Function Equilibria SFE whenthe shock density is su ciently evenly distributed, i.e. close to a uniform multidimensional distribution. In this case the demand shocks will smooth the residualdemand curve, so that its breakpoints disappear in expectation. But existence of SFE cannot be taken for granted. Perfectly correlated shocks or steep slopes anddiscontinuities in the shock density will not smooth the residual demand curvesu ciently well, and then procid:133table deviations from the cid:133rstorder solution willexist.7Our paper also diers from Wilson 42 in the source of randomness. In hismodel, local demand is certain in all markets but one, and transmission capacities are uncertain. This simplicid:133es the problem in an elegant way, especially formeshed networks. Nevertheless, even if our calculations are less straightforward,we cid:133nd it important to also analyze the multimarket case with local netdemandshocksvariations and known transmission capacities. We believe that our model 5Lin and Baldick 29 and Lin et al 30 also calculate cid:133rstorder conditions for transmissionnetworks with supply function oers, but their model is limited to cases with certain demand.6But Escobar and Jofre 17 show that there is normally a mixedstrategy NE in those cases.Adler et al. 1 and Hu and Ralph 26 show that existence of purestrategy Cournot NE dependson the assumptions made about the rationality of the players. Hobbs et al 21 bypasses theexistence issue by using conjectural variations instead of a Nash equilibrium. Willems 41 analysehow a network operatorcid:146s rule to allocate transmission capacity incid:135uences the Cournot NE. Weiand Smeers 40 calculate Cournot NE in transmission networks with regulated transmissionprices. Oren 33 calculates Cournot NE in a network with transmission rights.7Note that a discontinuity in a nodecid:146s shock density is cid:133ne as long as it occurs when transportcapacities in all arcs to the node are binding.4if arc k is oriented away from node i,if arc k is oriented towards node i;cid:01;1;0; otherwise.aik 8:is of particular relevance for markets with longlived bids, such as PJM8, whereproducerscid:146 oers are cid:133xed during the whole day to meet a wide range of localdemand outcomes. Also large local netdemand shocks can occur on short notice,especially in electricity networks with signicid:133cant amounts of wind power, so ourmodel is also relevant for markets with short lived bids.2 The model We shall consider markets for a single commodity that is traded over a networkconsisting of M nodes that are connected by N directed transport arcs. Weassume that each pair of nodes are connected by at most one arc. The network isconnected, so that there is at least one chain of arcs between every two nodes inthe network. Thus we have that N cid:21 M cid:0 1. As is standard in graph theory, thetopology of the network can be described by a nodearc incidence matrix A 11.9This matrix A has a row for every node and a column for every arc, and ikcid:0thelement aik decid:133ned as follows 10:Every arc starts in one node and ends in another node, so by decid:133nition we havethat the rows of A add up to a row vector with zeros. Thus the rows are linearlydependent. It can be shown that the incidence matrix A of a connected networkhas rank M cid:0 1 11.The transported quantity in arc k is represented by the variable tk which canbe positive or negative, the latter indicating a cid:135ow in the opposite direction fromthe orientation of the arc. Thus the ith row of At represents the cid:135ow of thecommodity into node i from the rest of the network. Transportation is assumedto be lossless and costless, but each arc k has a capacity Kk, so the vector t of arccid:135ows satiscid:133es1At each node i there are ni suppliers who play a simultaneous move, one shotcid:0K cid:20 t cid:20 K:game. Each supplier oers a nondecreasing dierentiable supply function Qig p , g 1; 2; : : : ; ni,that decid:133nes how much each cid:133rm is prepared to supply at price p. There can bemany cid:133rms in each node, but for simplicity we assume that each cid:133rm is only active 8PJM is the largest existing deregulated wholesale electricity market. Originally PJM coordinated the movement of wholesale electricity in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland. Now PJM has expanded to also cover all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan,North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia.9This is dierent to Wilson 42 who describes the network with power transfer distributionfactors PTDFs.node i.10Many authors adopt a dierent convention in which aik 1 if arc k is oriented away from 5netsupply in each node by Si pi Pnicomponents by sp. We also introduce Si;cid:0g pi Pniin one node. Nonstrategic netdemand at each node i is Dipi,11 where Dip isa nonincreasing function of p and i is a random local shock having a known probability distribution with joint density f 1; 2; : : : ; M . The demand shocks are realized after cid:133rms have committed to their oers. We denote the total deterministicg1 Qig picid:0Dipi and the vector with suchh1;h 6g Qih pi cid:0 Dipi,which excludes the supply of cid:133rm g from the deterministic netsupply in node i.We assume that there are many small pricetaking traders active in the network. After the demand shocks have been realized, they buy in some nodes,transport the commodity through the network without violating its physical constraints, and then sell it in other nodes. The market is cleared when all procid:133tablefeasible trades have been exhausted. Equivalently it can be assumed that the network is cleared by a pricetaking operator, i.e. it chooses demand and output ineach node in order to maximize the stated 12 social welfare of market participantswithout violating the networkcid:146s technical constraints. Similar to a uniformpriceauction, we assume that accepted oers are paid the local clearing price at theirnode. In electric power networks this is called nodal pricing 152235. Hence,for each realization the market will be cleared by a set of prices that decid:133nes howmuch each supplier produces and what is transported through the network. Theclearing prices ensure that netdemand equals netimports in every node, i.e.At sp :2We assume that each producer is riskneutral and chooses its supply curve inorder to maximize its expected procid:133t. Expost, after demand shocks have beenrealized and prices and cid:133rmcid:146s output have been determined, the payo of cid:133rm gin node i is given by:3where p is the local price in node i, q is the output of the cid:133rm and Cig q isthe cid:133rmcid:146s dierentiable, convex and increasing production cost up to its capacityconstraint qig.cid:5igp; q pq cid:0 Cig q ;price.We let p be the highest realized price in the market. For networks with inelasticdemand we let p C0igcid:0qigcid:1 be a reservation price that puts a cap on the monopoly The residual demand curve of a cid:133rm is the market demand that is not met byother cid:133rms in the industry at a given price. The slope of this curve is importantin the calculation of a cid:133rmcid:146s optimal oer. The demand shocks are additive, sothey will not change the slope of a cid:133rmcid:146s residual demand, as long as the same setof arcs are congested in the cleared market. Thus similar to Wilson 42 we cid:133ndit useful to group shock outcomes for which the same set of arcs are congestedin the cleared market. If two market outcomes for dierent realizations haveexactly the same arcs with tk cid:0Kk and the same arcs with tk Kk then wesay that they are in the same congestion state !. For each congestion state, we 11Note that this is netdemand, so it is not necessarily nonnegative. For example, cid:135uctuatingwindpower from small nonstrategic cid:133rms can result in negative netdemand shocks.12The operator acts as if submitted oers recid:135ect true marginal costs.6denote by L!, B!, and U ! the sets of arcs where cid:135ows are at their lowerbound i.e. congested in the negative direction, between their bounds or at theirupper bound, respectively.2.1 Optimality conditions In monopoly and Cournot markets without transport constraints the cid:133rstordercondition is:cid:0D0 pi.e. the output is chosen such that the marginal cost equals the marginal revenue.Alternatively, the same condition can be written as:C0 q p cid:0q;q p cid:0 C0 q cid:0D0 p ;i.e. the optimal output is proportional to the cid:133rmcid:146s markup and the absolutevalue of the slope of the demand. The condition is similar in a market withsupply function competition and no transport constraints. But in this case theslope of cid:133rm icid:146s residual demand is also incid:135uenced by the slope of its competitorscid:146supply, Q0cid:0i p, i.e. 27qi p cid:0 C0i qicid:0Q0cid:0i p cid:0 D0 pcid:1 :Another dierence with supply functions in isolated nodes is that cid:133rm i can chooseits oer so that the output becomes optimal for every price. Thus even if there isan additive shock in the demand, cid:133rm i can still choose its supply function suchthat the resulting output is optimal for every shock realization. This property ofthe supply function equilibrium is referred to as expost optimality.Solving for the equilibrium in our model is more complicated than for thestandard SFE model, because there are many dierent vectors of shock realizations that can result in the same local price in a cid:133rmcid:146s node. Moreover, dierenttransmission lines may be congested for the same price in a cid:133rmcid:146s node. Thus theslope of a cid:133rmcid:146s residual demand is typically not pinned down by its nodal price,so supply function equilibria in our setting are not expost optimal. Instead wewill in the next section show that cid:133rm icid:146s exante optimal output is given by itsmarkup times the expected slope of its residual demand conditional on the cid:133rmsoutput. We need to condition the slope of the residual demand on cid:133rm icid:146s outputas congestion in the network depends on this output.As in Anderson and Philpott 4, we use the market distribution function igp; q to characterize the uncertainty in the residual demand curve of cid:133rm g innode i. For given oers of the competitors this function returns the probabilitythat an oer p; q from the cid:133rm is rejected.13 The expected payo is given bythe lineintegral 4:13Note that the market distribution function is analogous to Wilsoncid:146s 43 probability distribution of the market price, which returns acceptance probabilities for oers. The main contributionof Anderson and Philpottcid:146s analysis is that it provides a global secondorder condition for optimality.7ZQigpcid:5igp; qd igp; q:4Thus, for any oer curve Qig p, the market distribution function contains allinformation of the residual demand that a cid:133rm needs to calculate its expectedprocid:133t. It does not matter whether the rejection probability is driven by propertiesof the demand, competitorscid:146oers or the network. As long as the cid:133rmcid:146s acceptedoers are paid a local uniformprice, we can still apply Anderson and Philpottcid:146soptimality condition. We decid:133ne Z p; q cid:5igq igp cid:0 igqcid:5igpcid:0p cid:0 C0igqcid:1 igp cid:0 q igq:5It can be shown that an oer curve Qigp is globally optimal if it satiscid:133es 4:Z p; q cid:21 0 if q QigpZ p; q 0 if q QigpZ p; q cid:20 0 if q Qigp:68:Intuitively we can explain the cid:133rstorder condition Z p; q 0 as follows. Thesame market distribution function rejection probability can be generated bydierent randomizations of the residual demand curve.In particular the samemarket distribution function can be generated by randomizing over crossing ornoncrossing residual demand curves. Still, it follows from 4 that as long asthe market distribution function is the same, expected procid:133ts and the optimaloer for cid:133rm g do not change. Thus, even if our randomization is dierent, wecan simplify the derivation of cid:133rst and secondorder conditions by considering asimpler equivalent case, where ig p; q has been generated by a randomizationover noncrossing residual demand curves forming the contours of ig p; q. In thiscase, it is obvious that the expected procid:133t of cid:133rm g in node i is globally maximizedif the payo is globally optimized for each outcome of its residual demand curve,i.e. the oer is expost optimal. Thus it follows from the equivalence argumentthat the expected procid:133t of cid:133rm g in node i is globally maximized if the payois globally optimized for each contour of ig p; q irrespective of how the marketdistribution function was generated. A necessary condition for this is that thesupply curve Qig p crosses each contour of ig p; q at a point where the latteris tangent to the cid:133rmcid:146s isoprocid:133t line. This is illustrated in Figure 1.Hence, the following conditions must be satiscid:133ed at every point along theoptimal supply curve.From 3 we havedqdpcid:12cid:12cid:12cid:12 igp;qconstdqdpcid:12cid:12cid:12cid:12cid:5ig p;qconst cid:0:dqdpcid:12cid:12cid:12cid:12cid:5igp;qconstq cid:12cid:12cid:12cid:12cid:12cid:5ig p;qconstcid:5igpcid:5ig 8 cid:0 qpcid:0C0igq :78Figure 1: Contours of igq; p thin and isoprocid:133t lines for cid:25igq; p dashed.The optimal curve q Qigp solid passes through the points where these curveshave the same slope.Similarly,dqdpcid:12cid:12cid:12cid:12 ig p;qconst Now 7, 8 and 9 together imply that cid:0 igp igq cid:12cid:12cid:12cid:12cid:12 ig p;qconst: igp igqcid:5igpcid:5igqqpcid:0C0igq;910which is identical to the cid:133rstorder condition given by 5 and Z p; q 0. Theglobal secondorder condition in 6 ensures that procid:133ts increase to the right ofeach contour of ig p; q.In order to apply the cid:133rst and secondorder conditions we need to calculate thederivatives igq , which depend on competitorscid:146oers, the joint densityf 1; 2; : : : ; M and the properties of the network. In the next section we calculatethese derivatives for radial networks.p and ig 3 Radial networks We begin our analysis by focusing on radial networks i.e. trees with M nodesand N M cid:0 1 arcs forming an acyclic connected graph. The generalization tomeshed networks with N M cid:0 1 is presented in Section 4. In radial networksthere is a unique transport route between any two nodes in the network. Thusnetwork cid:135ows are straightforwardly determined by netsupply in the nodes, whichsimplicid:133es the clearing process of the market.We start this section by exploring some special properties of the nodearcincidence matrix A for a radial network. Let Ai be row i of matrix A, and let 9qpAcid:0i be matrix A with row i eliminated. For connected radial networks, it can beshown that Acid:0i is nonsingular with determinant 1 or 1 10. We also have thefollowing technical results.Lemma 1 Suppose A is the nodearc incidence matrix for a radial network with M nodes. If j M then det Acid:0j cid:0 det Acid:0j1Proof. Introduce a new matrix Z which is identical to Acid:0j, except that rowj of Acid:0j, which is equal to Aj1, has been replaced by the sum of all rows in Acid:0j. Such manipulations are allowed without changing the determinant 37, sodet Z det Acid:0j. Nodearc incidence matrices are such that the sum of all rowsin Acid:0j is equal to cid:0Aj row j of A. Thus Z is identical to Acid:0j1 except thatelements have opposite signs in row j. In the calculation of the determinants wecan expand them along row j of both Z and Acid:0j1, which gives the stated result37.By applying Lemma 1 jk cid:0 jj times we get the following result.Corollary 2 If A is the nodearc incidence matrix for a radial network thencid:01j det Acid:0j cid:01k det Acid:0k Next we analyse the market clearing conditions for radial networks. We decid:133necid:26 to be the vector of nonnegative shadow prices one for each arc for cid:135ows in thepositive direction. Similarly, we decid:133ne cid:27 to be the vector of nonnegative shadowprices one for each arc for cid:135ows in the negative direction. Hence, the marketclearing conditions for a radial network are 14Ap cid:26 cid:0 cid:270 cid:20 cid:26 ? K cid:0 t cid:21 00 cid:20 cid:27 ? K t cid:21 0At sp :11The cid:133rst condition states that the shadow price for the arc gives the dierence innodal prices between the endpoints. The second and third set of conditions arecalled complementary slackness. They imply that the shadow price of an arc canonly be strictly positive if the arc is congested in the direction associated with theshadow price. Hence, if two nodes are connected by a congested arc then the priceat the importing end will be at least as large as the price in the exporting end,which ensures that there are no feasible procid:133table arbitrage trades in the radialnetwork. Another implication of the complementary slackness conditions is thatnodes connected by uncongested arcs will form a zone with the same market price.We say that such nodes are completely integrated. The fourth condition ensuresthat netdemand equals netimports in every node.Recall that for a given !, L!, B!, and U ! are the sets of arcs wherecid:135ows are at their lower bound i.e. congested in the negative direction, between 14We derive these KarushKuhnTucker conditions formally for more general cases in Section 4.10their bounds or at their upper bound, respectively. Thus we realize that thecomplementary slackness conditions can be equivalently written as follows:cid:27k 0;tk Kk;tk 2 cid:0Kk; Kktk cid:0Kk;cid:27k cid:21 0;cid:27k 0;cid:26k cid:21 0;cid:26k 0;k 2 U !;cid:26k 0; k 2 B!;k 2 L!:Observe that given a congestion state ! and arc k, there is at most one variabletk, cid:26k or cid:27k that is not at a bound.As in Wilson 42, we choose an arbitrary node i to be a cid:147trading hubcid:148 withnodal price p. In the following we will express the other nodal prices pcid:0i in termsof p and the shadow prices. Let 1Mcid:01 be a column vector of M cid:0 1 ones and 0Mcid:01be a column vector of M cid:0 1 zeros. We know that the columns of AT sum to acolumn vector of zeros. Hence,Using this result, we can write the market clearing condition Ap cid:26 cid:0 cid:27 asfollows:12i 0Mcid:01ATi cid:01Mcid:01:cid:0Acid:0icid:1T 1Mcid:01 ATcid:0icid:1Tcid:17cid:01cid:16cid:0Acid:0Acid:0icid:1T pcid:0ip ATpcid:0i cid:16cid:0Acid:0icid:1Tcid:17cid:01cid:0cid:26 cid:0 cid:27cid:0p ATicid:1pcid:0i p 1Mcid:01 cid:16cid:0AE cid:16cid:0Acid:0icid:1Tcid:17cid:01cid:0icid:1Tcid:17cid:01i cid:26 cid:0 cid:27cid:26 cid:0 cid:27 :To simplify this further we introduce We partition t, A, E and the shadow prices cid:27 and cid:26 into t L, t B, t U, AL, AB,AU, EL, EB, EU, cid:27L, 0B, 0U and 0L, 0B, cid:26U corresponding to cid:135ows at theirupper bounds, strictly between their bounds, and at their lower bounds.

Hence, S! is the total volume in t, cid:27 and cid:26 space that isspanned for a congestion state !.3.1 Optimality conditions for radial networks In order to apply the optimality conditions in 5 and 6, we need to derive themarket distribution function ig q; p. It is the probability that an oer q at pricep from cid:133rm g in node i is rejected. Thus the calculation of this function involvesdetermining a market outcome for every realization of the vector , and thenintegrating the density function f over the volume in space that correspondsto cid:133rm gcid:146s oer not being fully accepted.In the general case this volume iscomplicated and it is even more complicated to dierentiate ig q; p we needsuch derivatives in our optimality conditions if one follows this direct approach.Like Wilson 42, we avoid this by transforming the problem into one where weinstead integrate over the cid:135ows and shadow prices that arise in each congestionstate. In the following we take supply functions Qjh p of the competitors as givenand we want to calculate the best response of cid:133rm i in node g. For notationalconvenience we let node i, the node under study, be the trading hub with pricep. The trading hub is moved when optimality conditions are derived for a cid:133rm inanother node.we keep the output of cid:133rm g cid:133xed while the price p When calculating i;gp;qpat node i is free to change. Thus we set Qjh p cid:26 q;j i, h g Qjh p ; otherwise ,16i.e. cid:133rm g in node i submits a Cournot oer. For any price p in node i, andshadow prices cid:26U ! and cid:27L! we denote by pp; cid:26; cid:27 the vector of nodal pricesdecid:133ned by 13, and by spp; cid:26; cid:27 the corresponding vector of netsupply atthe nodes including Qjh p decid:133ned by 16, where we choose to suppress thedependence on ! for notational convenience. We want to transform the volumein cid:0space into a corresponding volume in t, cid:27 and cid:26 space for variables thatare not at a bound. To make this substitution of variables when computing themultidimensional integral, we need the following factor to represent the changein measure 8, p. 368.cid:0t B!; cid:26U !; cid:27L!;cid:25cid:1cid:12cid:12cid:12cid:12cid:12,17the absolute value of the determinant of the Jacobian matrix representing thechange of variables. Thus the rejection probability, i.e. the probability that themarket clearing price cid:25 at node i is less than p can be calculated from Jp! cid:12cid:12cid:12cid:12cid:12cid:25cid:01ZS! i;g p; q X!

For each state ! we partition the nodes into thesets cid:4 ! and z !. cid:4 ! includes all nodes that are completely integrated withnode i, the arbitrarily picked trading hub, through some uncongested chain of arcs.The set z ! contains all other nodes in the network. Similarly we partition theshock vector into cid:4! and z!.Given a state !, the price in node i and all nodes j 2 cid:4 ! is cid:25 irrespectiveof cid:26U ! and cid:27L!. Thus it follows from 2 and 16 thatjcid:26kjcid:27kjcid:25 s 0j pj s 0j pjpjcid:26kpjcid:27k cid:26 S0j cid:25S0j;cid:0g cid:25 0; if j 2 cid:4 ! and k 2 U ! 0; if j 2 cid:4 ! and k 2 L !if j 2 cid:4 !niif j i:242526The arcs are partitioned as follows. We let tcid:4! be the cid:135ows in the uncongestedarcs between nodes in the set cid:4 ! and we let tz! be the vector of cid:135ows in the 13other arcs. In particular, the vector tz B! denotes uncongested cid:135ows in the otherarcs. Here Mcid:4! is the number of nodes in cid:4 ! and we note that they mustbe connected by Mcid:4! cid:0 1 arcs. We use the nodearc incidence matrix Acid:4! todescribe the connected radial network with nodes in cid:4 ! and arcs with cid:135owstcid:4! connecting nodes in this set. We let Az! be a nodearc incidence matrixwith M cid:0 Mcid:4! rowsnodes and M cid:0 Mcid:4! columnsarcs, describing the rest ofthe network. 15 Using this notation, the nodal cid:135ow balance in 2 can be writtenas follows:Acid:4!tcid:4! scid:4!p cid:4!Az!tz! sz!p z!: cid:0Acid:4!cid:1kj 0 cid:0Az!cid:1kj 0:cid:0cid:4!cid:1kcid:0tcid:4!cid:1jcid:0cid:4!cid:1kcid:16tz B!cid:17jcid:0z!cid:1kcid:0tz!cid:1jcid:0z!cid:1kcid:0tcid:4!cid:1j We can now show the following:Lemma 3 Jp! cid:16S0i;cid:0g cid:25 Pk 2cid:4!ni S0k cid:25cid:17 Jz!, where Thusand Let27282930313233cid:4!z!cid:25cid:25 35Proof.

Also the remainder of the network is not necessarily connected.14When calculating Jp!, we will expand the determinant along the Mth columnin 32 with entries kcid:25 giving the netsupply slopes as shown in 26.

The term P! P p; q; ! is then theprobability that g is dispatched in the interval q; q dq given that the clearingprice is p. The cid:133rstorder optimality condition is given by Z p; q 0, so itimmediately follows from 37 that:16Corollary 7 The optimal output q of cid:133rm g in node i at price p satiscid:133es thecid:133rstorder condition:q cid:0p cid:0 C0igqcid:1X!where 0S0i;cid:0g p Xk 2cid:4!ni S0k p1A P !jp; q ;P jp; q : RS f At s pp; cid:26; cid:27 Jzdt Bcid:22!dcid:26U cid:22!dcid:27Lcid:22!P!RS! f At s pp; cid:26; cid:27 Jz!dt Bcid:22!dcid:26U cid:22!dcid:27Lcid:22!is the conditional probability that the network is in state given that the price innode i is p and cid:133rm g has output q.Recall that in a singlenode network, the optimal output of a producer isproportional to its markup and the slope of the residual demand that it is facing27. In a network with multiple connected nodes, producer g in node i only facesthe slope of the netsupply in nodes that are completely integrated with its ownnode. Thus according to Corollary 7, the slope of netsupply in each other node isscaled by the conditional probability that this node is completely integrated withnode i. Hence, for multidimensional shocks, Klemperer and Meyercid:146s conditiongeneralizes to saying that the optimal output of a producer is proportional to itsmarkup and the expected slope of the residual demand that it is facing. Thiscid:133rstorder condition is consistent with Wilsoncid:146s results 42. We notice that incase all transmissionlines have unlimited capacities, we get the Klemperer and Meyer condition for a completely integrated network. The other extreme whenall transmissionlines have zero capacity, yields the KlempererMeyer equation forthe isolated node i.Decid:133nition 8 For cid:133rm g in node i we decid:133ne the market integration factor bycid:22ig p; q X!Mcid:4!P !jp; q :Thus, the market integration factor is equal to the expected number of nodesincluding node i itself that are completely integrated with node i given thatcid:133rm g has output q and node i has the market price p. As we will see in the nextsection, this factor is useful when characterizing SFE in symmetric networks.3.2 Examples By means of Corollary 7 we are able to construct a cid:133rstorder condition for eachcid:133rm in the radial network. The supply function equilibrium SFE can be solvedfrom a system of such cid:133rstorder conditions. The global secondorder conditionof an available cid:133rstorder solution can be vericid:133ed by 6. In this section we usethese optimality conditions to derive SFE for twonode and star networks withsymmetric cid:133rms.173.2.1 Two node network Consider a simple network with two nodes connected by one transmissionline fromnode 1 to node 2 with cid:135ow t 1 2 cid:0K1; K1.

The existence of an equilibrium depends on the partial derivativesfi 1; 2, i 1; 2, of the shock density which must be su ciently small.Itcan be shown that symmetric solutions to 43 are equilibria under the followingcircumstances.Proposition 10 Consider a twonode network with n symmetric cid:133rms in eachnode, each cid:133rm having identical marginal costs that are either constant or strictlyincreasing. If demand is inelastic up to a price cap p C0q, and has a boundedshock density that satiscid:133es 2nq jfi 1; 2j cid:20 3n cid:0 2 f 1; 2 when 1; 2 2cid:0K1; q K1 cid:2 cid:0K1; q K1 : f1 2 cid:20 2qg, then there exists a unique symmetric supply function equilibrium in the network, where each cid:133rmcid:146s monotonicoer, Q p, can be calculated from:Q0p P p;Q;!1P p;Q;!2P p;Q;!3Qpcid:0C0Q2ncid:01P p;Q;!1ncid:01P p;Q;!2ncid:01P p;Q;!344for p 2 C0 0 ; p with the initial condition Q p q.Proof. The dierential equation in the statement follows from 43, inelasticdemand and symmetry of the network. Moreover, the equilibrium is symmetric,so that S2 p n Q p and S1;cid:0g p n cid:0 1 Q p. In case that productioncapacity binds at some price pb p then Qp is inelastic in the range pb; p,and it follows from 40 that Zq; p 0 when q q and p 2 pb; p, which wouldviolate the secondorder condition in 6. Thus the production capacity must bindat the price cap, which gives our initial condition.We cid:133rst show that the solution is unique.

Consider a price p 2 C0 0 ; p.We now want to show that p cid:0 C0Q p is bounded away from zero in the rangep; p. This is obvious for constant marginal costs, as we then have that p cid:0C0 Q p p cid:0 C0 0 0. For strictly increasing marginal costs we can use thefollowing argument. It follows from PicardLindelcid:246fcid:146s theorem and p C0q thata unique solution to 44 must exist for some range p 0; p. In this price range themarkup, p cid:0 C0Q p, is smallest at some price pcid:3 where the supply function is C00Qpcid:3. Thus it followsat least as steep as the marginal cost curve, i.e. Q0pcid:3 cid:20from 44 that 1pcid:3 cid:0 C0Qpcid:3 cid:21 Qpcid:3C00Qpcid:3cid:11pcid:3;Qpcid:3cid:12pcid:3;Qpcid:3;20which is bounded away from zero whenever Qpcid:3 and C00 Qpcid:3 are boundedaway from zero. In case Qpcid:3 0 for some price pcid:3 C0 0, it follows from 44that Q0p 0 for p 2 p; pcid:3. Thus it follows from PicardLindelcid:246fcid:146s theorem andthe properties of 44 that a unique monotonic symmetric solution will exist forthe price interval p; p.We now verify the global second order conditions. We know from 6 that thesolution is an equilibrium if Zq; p cid:21 0 when q cid:20 Q p and Zq; p cid:20 0 whenq cid:21 Q p. We have from 40 that Zq; p p cid:0 C0qcid:12p; qQ0 p cid:0 qcid:11p; q:As cid:12p; Qp cid:21 0 we can equivalently verify that Xq; p cid:17Zq; pcid:12p; q cid:17 p cid:0 C0qQ0 p cid:0cid:11p; qcid:12p; qqis nonincreasing with respect to q. This follows since Xqq; p cid:20 0 implies that Zqq; p cid:20 0 whenever Zq; p 0.

To simplify the optimality conditions we consider the case where demandshocks follow a uniform multidimensional distribution.Assumption 1: Consider a network with two nodes connected by a transmissionline with capacity K1 and with n symmetric cid:133rms in each node. Demand ineach node is given by i D p. Without loss of generality we let D C00 0.16 We assume that shocks are uniformly distributed with a constant density,, on the surface 1; 2 2 cid:0K1; nq cid:0 D p K1 cid:2 cid:0K1; nq cid:0 D p K1 :1V1f 0 cid:20 1 2 cid:20 2nq cid:0 2D pg and zero elsewhere.Proposition 11 Make Assumption 1, then the symmetric cid:133rstorder conditionfor cid:133rm i in node g is given by:where the market integration factor is given by Q p cid:0 C0Q cid:22n cid:0 1 Q0 cid:0 cid:22D0 ;cid:22 1 P !1jp; q 4K1 nq cid:0 D p2K1 nq cid:0 D p4849:For inelastic demand, solutions to 48 are SFE, and the inverse symmetric supplyfunctions can be calculated from:p Q Qcid:01 Q p Qcid:22ncid:01qcid:22ncid:01 cid:22n cid:0 1 Qcid:22ncid:01Z q QC0 u duucid:22n:50For linear demand i a cid:0 bpi; a; b 0, in each node and constant marginal costsc, solutions to 48 are SFE and given by:b p cid:0 ccid:22ncid:02 cid:22ncid:01cid:18 p cid:0 cp cid:0 ccid:19cid:22ncid:02cid:22ncid:01cid:0 1! ;51Q p where p qcid:22b :16Note that this is just a normalization of the demand shock.22Proof. It follows from the decid:133nitions of P p; q; !1, P p; q; !2 and P p; q; !3in 41 that under Assumption 1 we get:P p; q; !3 f q S1;cid:0g p K1; 2 d2 d2V1 S2pV1S2pcid:0K1Rcid:011RS2pK1K1Rcid:0K1P p; q; !2 f q S1;cid:0g p cid:0 K1; 2 d2 P p; q; !1 f q S1;cid:0g p cid:0 t 1; S2 p t 1 dt 1 cid:0K1cid:0DC00S2pcid:0K1RRS2pK1nqcid:0DpK1d2V1 nqcid:0Dpcid:0S2pV1K1Rcid:0K1dt 1V1 2K1V1:5253:Thus P !1jp; q P p; q; !1P!

Next, we note the similarities withthe cid:133rstorder condition for singlenode networks with m symmetric cid:133rms 27.17Q p cid:0 C0Q Q0 m cid:0 1 cid:0 D0 :55By comparing 48 and 55 we can conclude that the cid:133rstorder solution of a cid:133rmin a symmetric twonode network with n cid:133rms per node is the same as for a cid:133rmin an isolated node with cid:22n symmetric cid:133rms and demand cid:22D0 . Thus analyticalsolutions to 55 are also solutions to 48 when m cid:22n. For example, for singlenode networks, we know that explicit solutions can be derived for symmetric cid:133rmsfacing an inelastic demand and that these solutions are monotonic 52334,which gives us 50. Moreover, we know that monotonic closedform solutionsexist for symmetric cid:133rms with identical constant marginal costs that face a lineardemand 24, which gives us 51. It follows from Proposition 10 that both of thesemonotonic solutions constitute SFE.Recall that the market integration factor cid:22 is the expected number of nodesthat are completely integrated with a node in the network and that a node is alwayscompletely integrated with itself. Firms can incid:135uence congestion and the marketintegration factor with their oer curves. Still it is a constant in equilibrium.It does not depend on costs, the market price nor the number of cid:133rms whendemand shocks are uniformly distributed.It follows from Proposition 11 thatthe equilibrium oer of a cid:133rm in the twonode network with n symmetric cid:133rmsper node is identical to the equilibrium oer of a cid:133rm in an isolated node withcid:22n symmetric cid:133rms. Fig. 3 illustrates how the total supply function in a nodedepends on cid:22n if the total production capacity in each node is kept cid:133xed.17Note that P !1jp; q, which is calculated in 52, and accordingly the optimal output in54 depend on the shock distribution, while expost optimal oers in a single node network donot depend on the shock distribution.23Figure 3: Total supply curve in one node with inelastic demand and constantmarginal costs up to a cid:133xed total production capacity, nq. Here n is the numberof cid:133rms per node and cid:22 is the expected number of nodes that are completelyintegrated with a node in the network.From the single node case 2324, we know that solutions to 50 and 51behave as expected:Corollary 12 i Markups are positive for a positive output, and ii for a giventotal nodal output and nodal production cost function, markups decrease withmore elastic demand and with more cid:133rms in the market or with more marketintegration.Proposition 10 ensures existence of equilibria when slopes in the shock densityare su ciently small. However, existence is problematic for steep slopes in theshock density and especially so when it has discontinuities. This is illustrated bythe nonexistence example below.Example 13 Shock densities with discontinuities: Assume that the supportof the shock i; i 2 f 1; 2g is given by 0; . The density is dierentiable insidethe support set, but decreases discontinuously by cid:1f 2 0 when 1 and2 2 0; . Consider a potential symmetric NE of a duopoly market with onecid:133rm in each node with identical costs C q. Assume that the symmetric supplyfunctions Q p are monotonic, that demand is inelastic and that qK1 2K1.Thus unlike the distribution in Assumption 1, the demand shock can reach itsdiscontinuity even if the transport capacity is nonbinding. In the following we willshow that cid:133rm 1 will have a procid:133table deviation from the potential symmetric purestrategy NE. In particular we will consider the point q 0; p 0 where q 0 Q p 0 cid:0 K1.

Wilson 42 outlines a solution of the cid:133rstorder conditionfor this case, but he did not verify the secondorder conditions for his setting.The example below illustrates why such a cid:133rstorder solution is normally not anequilibrium in our setting.Example 14 Perfectly correlated shocks: Consider two nodes connected byone transmissionline. Demand shocks in the two nodes are perfectly correlated.This means that market prices are driven by a onedimensional uncertainty andas in Klemperer and Meyercid:146s 27 model of single markets, one would expect SFEin such a twonode network to be expost optimal. Wilson 42 provides a setof cid:133rstorder conditions, from which a potentially expost optimal SFE can bederived. Following him we assume that the line is congested for prices above pcid:3and uncongested for lower prices. Assume that the cid:133rstorder condition resultsin a wellbehaved monotonic solution for each cid:133rm, where markups are strictlypositive at pcid:3. We also assume that D0i 0; i 2 f 1; 2g, so that the slope of residualdemand is always strictly negative. Consider a cid:133rm g in the importing node, whichwe without loss of generality denote node 1, with the cid:133rstorder solution Q1g p.We use 40 and consider the ratio X1gq; p : Z1gq;pX!P p;q;! p cid:0 C01gqS0jp S01;cid:0g pP !1jp; qp cid:0 C01gqS01;cid:0g p P !2 !3jp; q cid:0 q;P p;q;!1P p;q;!2P p;q;!3 is the conditional probability that the P p;q;!1where P !1jp; q 25Figure 4: Star network example.P2p;q;!3P2p;q;!2line is uncongested and P !2 !3jp; q P p;q;!1P2p;q;!2P2p;q;!3 is the conditional probability that the line is congested. Consider a price p 0 pcid:3. Weknow that X1gQ1g p 0 ; p 0 Z1gQ1g p 0 ; p 0 0, that P !1jp 0; Q1g p 0 1and that P !2 !3jp 0; Q1g p 0 0. Now, assume that cid:133rm g withholds a sufcid:133cient amount of power cid:1Q 0 such that P !1jp 0; Q1g p 0 cid:0 cid:1Q 0 and P !2 !3jp 0; Q1g p 0 cid:0 cid:1Q 1. Less withholding is needed to congest the linefor prices p 0 su ciently close to pcid:3. We have D0i 0 and Q0ih cid:21 0, so S0jp 0,which implies that X1gq;p 0 0 for p 0su ciently close to pcid:3. Thus the secondorder condition is not locally satiscid:133ed atsuch points. The intuition is that a producer in an importing node always has anincentive to unilaterally deviate from the cid:133rstorder solution by withholding powerin order to congest the transmissionline at lower prices than pcid:3, which increasesthe price of the importing node.cid:12cid:12cid:12qQ1gp 0cid:12cid:12cid:12qQ1gp 0 0 and that Z1gq;p 0qq 3.2.2 Star network In our second case we will consider a star network with four nodes and threeradial lines with capacity K, as shown in Figure 4. We decid:133ne all arcs to bedirected towards the center node 4. Each arc has the same number as the startingnode, i.e. 1; 2 or 3.Local netimports must equal netdemand in every node, so123426643775 2664ThusspS1 p 1S2 p 2S3 p 3S4 p 43775z Acid:01 242664cid:01000 cid:0100 cid:010111:t 1t 2t 337752435 z t57Az 1 3500 cid:0100 cid:011126and E cid:16Acid:01Tcid:17cid:01241 cid:01010 cid:01010 35 :58Each line ti has three congestion states.

When the line is congested towards node 4 we haveti K, cid:27i 0, and cid:26i cid:21 0 and when the line is congested away from node 4 wehave ti cid:0K, cid:27i cid:21 0, and cid:26i 0. Altogether there are 3 cid:2 3 cid:2 3 27 congestionstates as shown in Table 1.Demand shocks are decid:133ned on the following region cid:2:cid:2 cid:26 1; 2; 3; 4 2 R4j cid:0 K cid:20 i cid:20 nq cid:0 D p K;cid:03K cid:20 4 cid:20 3K;0 cid:20 1 2 3 4 cid:20 3nq cid:0 3D p 8i 2 f 1; 2; 3g :cid:27and we let V2 be the volume of this region.Assumption 2. Consider a star network with four nodes and three radial lineswith capacity K directed towards the center node 4. There are n cid:133rms with identicalcosts C q in each node 1cid:0 3. There are no producers in node 4 the center nodeand demand is inelastic here, i.e. S4 p 4 cid:17 0. Demand in nodes i 2 f 1; 2; 3g isgiven by i D p. Without loss of generality we let D C00 0.18 Demandshocks are uniformly distributed such that:f cid:26 1V20if 2cid:2otherwise.Thus the shock density and network are symmetric with respect to nodes 1; 2; 3.We can show the following under these circumstances:Proposition 15 Make Assumption 2, then the symmetric cid:133rstorder conditionfor a cid:133rm in nodes i 2 f 1; 2; 3g is given by:Q p cid:0 C0Q cid:22n cid:0 1 Q0 cid:0 cid:22D0 ;with the market integration factorcid:22 3 nq cid:0 D p2 12K nq cid:0 D p 12K 23 nq cid:0 D p2 8K nq cid:0 D p 4K 2:5960For inelastic demand, solutions to 59 are SFE, and the unique inverse supplyfunction of each cid:133rm in nodes i 2 f 1; 2; 3g is given by 50.

It is only themarket integration factor that depends on whether the network has two nodes oris star shaped.294 Meshed network with potential cid:135ows So far we have studied radial networks, where there is a unique path betweenevery pair of nodes. Now we consider more complicated networks consisting of M nodes and N arcs, where N cid:21 M. This means that there will be at least onecycle in the network and there will be at least two paths between any two nodesin the cycle 11. Thus we need to make assumptions of how the transport route ischosen for cases when there are multiple possible paths. Here we assume that cid:135owsare determined by physical laws that are valid for electricity and incompressiblemediums with laminar nonturbulent cid:135ows. Such cid:135ows are sometimes calledpotential cid:135ows, because one can model them as being driven by the potentials cid:30in the nodes. In case the commodity is a gas or liquid e.g. oil, the potential is thepressure at the node. In a DC network it is the voltage that is the potential. For DC networks and laminar cid:135ows it can be shown that the electricity and cid:135ow choosepaths that minimizes total losses. For AC networks it is standard to calculateelectric power cid:135ows by means of a DCload cid:135ow approximation, where cid:30 is thevector of voltage phase angles at the nodes 15.In a potential cid:135ow model, the cid:135ow in the arc k is the result of the potentialdierence between its endpoints. Given a vector of potentials cid:30, we havetk cid:0cid:0Acid:30cid:1k Xk64where cid:0cid:0Acid:30cid:1k is the potential dierence and Xk is the impedance resisting thethe cid:135ow through the arc. The impedance is determined by the geometrical andmaterial properties of the linepipe that transports the commodity. Thus it is anexogenous parameter and independent of the cid:135ow in the arc. In a DC network, theimpedance is given by the resistance of the line. In a DCload cid:135ow approximationof an AC network, Xk represents the reactance of the transmission line. Thematrix A has rank M cid:0 1, so the potentials cid:30 are not uniquely decid:133ned by 64.Thus we can arbitrarily choose one node say i and set its potential cid:30i arbitrarily.Normally, the potential of this swing node is set to zero. This corresponds todeleting row i from A to form the matrix Acid:0i with rank M cid:0 1 37.To simplify the analysis we rule out some unrealistic or unlikely cases: weassume that the impedance is positive and that the capacities of the arcs andimpedance factors are such that for any feasible cid:135ow, the set of arcs with cid:135owsat a lower or upper bound contains no cycles. The latter assumption precludescertain degenerate solutions which can only arise if the values of the bounds andimpedances for arcs forming a loop L, satisfy equations of the formcid:14k Xk Kk 0Xk 2Lwhere cid:14k 1 if arc k is oriented in the direction that L is traversed and cid:14k cid:01otherwise. We can preclude instances having such solutions by perturbing the linecapacities if necessary.The market clearing conditions are less obvious in a meshed network. Asshown by 15, they can be constructed as the optimality conditions of an economic 30dispatch problem EDP formulated as follows:EDP: minimize PMg1R qigsubject to At q cid:0 y ;i1Pni 0 Qcid:01ig xdx cid:0PMi1R yi 0 Dcid:01i ydypcid:27; cid:26cid:21;The shadow prices for the constraints are shown on the righthand side in brackets.EDP seeks supply quantities q, demand y, and transported quantities t to maximize total producer and consumer welfare. The KarushKuhnTucker conditionsof EDP arecid:0K cid:20 t cid:20 K;Xt cid:0Acid:30:KKT: Ap Xcid:21 cid:26 cid:0 cid:270 cid:20 cid:26 ? K cid:0 t cid:21 00 cid:20 cid:27 ? K t cid:21 0Acid:21 0At sp Xt cid:0Acid:30In radial networks the columns of the matrix A correspond to network arcs decid:133ninga tree, and so they are linearly independent see 37. This means that Acid:21 0has a unique solution cid:21 0, which allows cid:21 to be removed from the marketclearing conditions.In this case the conditions become the same as those forradial networks in 11.We now return to discuss the general case. The prices p that satisfy the KKTconditions in any congestion state ! must meet certain conditions. First observethat since X is diagonal and nonsingular,Multiplying by A and using the KKT condition that Acid:21 0 yields Xcid:01Ap cid:21 Xcid:01cid:26 cid:0 cid:2765AXcid:01Ap AXcid:01cid:26 cid:0 cid:2766In the context of power systems networks the matrix AXcid:01A is called a networkadmittance matrix, and when X is the identity it is a Laplacian matrix. Thematrix AXcid:01A has rank M cid:0 1, so the price p is not uniquely determined bythe choice of cid:26 and cid:27. Recall that Ai is row i of matrix A, and Acid:0i is matrix Awith row i eliminated. As in section 3 we choose a node i, say, as trading hub andassign its price to be p.

For example, therows of H can be the orientation vectors of a set of N cid:0 M cid:0 1 cycles in thenetwork see 37.

As for the radial case, Jp! and Jq! aredecid:133ned by 17 and 21, respectively. But these determinants do not simplifyas in the radial case. The expressions 72 and 73 can be dierentiated andsubstituted into 5 and 6 to give optimality conditions in a meshed network.Unfortunately these are not as straightforward as the expressions obtained in theradial case in which each agent eectively faces a probabilityweighted residualdemand curve decid:133ned by Corollary 7. In the meshed case the residual demandcurve in a congestion state ! involves combinations of the slopes of competitorscid:146supply functions measured at dierent prices. In other words, nodes in a meshedmarket may be integrated in a congestion state in the sense that transport betweentheir nodes is possible with some adjustment in dispatch but still experiencedierent prices. This makes the computation of equilibrium a lot more challenging.5 Alternative market designs and strategies Finally, we want to briecid:135y note that our expressions in Section 3.1 for how marketdistribution functions can be calculated in radial networks are not restricted to SFE in networks with nodal pricing. They can also be used to calculate Cournot NE in networks with additive demand shocks. We know from Anderson and Philpott 4 that the optimality condition of a vertical oer q from cid:133rm g in nodei facing an uncertain residual demand is:Z p 0Z p; q dp 0with the secondorder condition that R p 0 Zq p; q dp cid:20 0. For radial networks with Cournot competition Z p; q can be calculated as in Proposition 6 if one sets S0k pk cid:0D0k pk :Our approach is not limited to cases with local uniformprices. As long as thenetwork operator accepts feasible oers and bids in order to maximize stated socialwelfare, it is often straightforward to adjust our optimality conditions to networkswith other auction formats. For example, consider networks with discriminatory 33pricing as in the electricity market of Britain. Anderson et al. 3 show that theoptimality condition of a cid:133rmcid:146s oer in such an auction is given by 19Z igpp cid:0 C0igq cid:0 1 ig q; p ;and the same conditions as in 6. For a radial network, igp and ig q; p aregiven by 18 and 19, respectively. Jp ! can be calculated as in 17, and Lemma 3.6 Conclusions We derive optimality conditions for cid:133rms oering supply functions into a radialtransmission network with transport constraints and local demand shocks. Weverify that monotonic solutions to the cid:133rstorder conditions are Supply Function Equilibria SFE when the joint probability density of the local demand shocks issu ciently evenly distributed, i.e. close to a uniform multidimensional distribution. But existence of SFE cannot be taken for granted. Perfectly correlated shocksor steep slopes and discontinuities in the shock density will not smooth the kinksin the residual demand curves su ciently well, and then procid:133table deviations fromthe cid:133rstorder solution will exist.In an isolated node, the optimal output of a producer is proportional to itsmarkup and the slope of the residual demand that it is facing. We show thatin a network with multidimensional shocks, this generalizes: the optimal output of a producer is proportional to its markup and the expected slope of theresidual demand that it is facing. Thus the probability with which the producercid:146snode is completely integrated with other nodes, i.e. connected to other nodes viauncongested arcs, is of great importance for the optimal oer.For symmetric equilibria it is useful to decid:133ne a market integration factor, whichequals the expected number of nodes that are completely integrated with particulara node; a node is always completely integrated with itself. We use our optimalityconditions to solve for symmetric equilibria in twonode and star networks withmultidimensional uniformly distributed demand shocks. We show that an equilibrium oer in a node of such a network is identical to the equilibrium oer in anisolated node where the number of symmetric cid:133rms per node has been scaled bythe market integration factor. Firms can incid:135uence the market integration factorwith their oer curves, so it is endogenous. Still, in our symmetric equilibria, themarket integration factor is constant for a given network with given transmissioncapacities and total production capacities. The factor does not depend on production costs nor on the number of symmetric cid:133rms. We also show that the symmetricequilibria are wellbehaved: i markups are positive for a positive output, andii for a given total production cost, markups decrease with more elastic demandand with more cid:133rms in the market or with more market integration.19Note that we have changed the sign of the Z function in Anderson et al 3 for payasbidmarkets to keep it consistent with the Z function used in this paper.34We focus on characterising SFE in radial networks, but we also show how ouroptimality conditions can be generalized to consider meshed networks, albeit witha signicid:133cant increase in complexity. We also present optimality conditions for SFE in networks with discriminatory pricing and Cournot NE in networks withuncertain demand. Typically each node in our network represents a geographicallocation, and typically a commodity is transported between two geographical locations. But nodes and transports in our network could be interpreted in a moregeneral sense. For example, a node could represent a point in time or a geographical location at a particular point in time. Moreover, storage at a geographicallocation can be represented by an arc that can transport the commodity to a laterpoint in time. The transport capacity of such an arc corresponds to the storagecapacity at the geographical location. Thus, in principle our approach could beused to model producerscid:146strategic behaviour in a network with local storage.References1 Adler, I., Oren, S., Yao, J. 2008.
