It presents data on the services of 2089 ISPs in thesummer of 1998. By this time, the Internet access industry had undergone its first wave of entry and many ISPs had begun to offer services other than basic access. This paper develops an Internet access industryproduct code which classifies these services. Significant heterogeneity across ISPs is found in thepropensity to offer these services, a pattern with an unconditional urbanrural difference. Most of theexplained variance in behavior arises from firmspecific factors, with only weak evidence of locationspecific factors for some services. These findings provide a window to the variety of approaches taken tobuild viable businesses organizations, a vital structural feature of this young market.1. Introduction How do vendors construct viable and ongoing economic entities in an evolving and technicallyintensive marketplace? This study sheds light on these processes through analyzing the services at 2089Internet Service Providers ISPs in the summer of 1998. This study investigates the propensity of an ISPto offer services other than routine and basic access.In 1998 the industrial structure of the ISP market was changing. Three features characterize thechange. For one, this market was growing rapidly, attracting thousands of entrants and many users,quickly achieving massmarket status Clemente 1998. Second, firms were becoming nearlygeographically pervasive, even in many low density areas Downes and Greenstein 1999. And third,firms were not settling on a standard menu of services to offer. This paper is the first to take steps towardsexplaining this last pattern. New services are an excellent example of how Internet technology had to be packaged in order toprovide value to commercial users. In practice establishing new services involved more than simplybuying and adapting capital goods. More typically it involved evaluating a technological possibility,making an educated guess about how to adapt it to customers, and tailoring investments to the goals of the ISP. Many factors potentially influenced this activity; this study statistically measures these factors,seeking to identify circumstances that produce variance in behavior across ISPs.I investigate four types of services: frontier access, networking, hosting and web design services.Because no government agency, such as the Census or the Bureau of Labor Statistics, has yet tocompletely categorize these services, this study and its companion paper Greenstein 2000b are the firsteconomic analyses to develop and employ a novel Internet access product code. This categorizationestablishes a common language for understanding experiments with new services, translating manytechnically obscure commercial services into concrete terms accessible to a general reader.The paper next estimates several statistical models of the determinants of an ISPs decision tooffer nonbasic services, dividing determinants into two classes, locationspecific factors or firmspecificfactors. Stated simply, do ISPs offer different services because the determinants of these choices varybetween services or between locations? For example, the geographic dispersion of determinants, such aslocal demand or infrastructure, might explain the geographic dispersion of propensities to offer services.Alternatively, the dispersion of firmspecific factors which are associated with new services, such as firmsize, might be found disproportionately in urban areas.The econometric analysis finds that firmspecific determinants are pivotal to the offering of nonbasic services. These include measures of a firms geographic scope, investments and its focus on nontechnical users. There is only weak evidence of locationspecific determinants, such as urbanization andpresence of professionals. New services tend to cluster together at firms and tend to be available more 1frequently in high density areas, an outcome partly influenced by economics of scope between old andnew services. More generally, the firmspecific factors that are associated with new services, such as firmsize and a focus on satisfying market demand by unsophisticated users, are disproportionately found in ISPs located in urban areas. Economies of scale also appear to be mild for services other than frontieraccess. Finally, networking and web design share many common market features, while high speedaccess and hosting share other determinants.Explaining the variety of approaches firms take to developing new services in technologyintensive markets has long been a topic of discussion in the economics of technology, industrialorganization and economic growth. This studys framework resembles that found in Bresnahan, Stern and Trajtenberg, 1997, in which a PC manufacturers attempt to differentiate from common competitors mayresult in temporary returns if competitors eventually learn to provide close substitutes. Similarly, here an ISP uses new services to differentiate from other competitors. The open measurement question here, asthere, concerns the dimensions over which the firms differentiate as well as their determinants. Onenovelty of this paper is its proposal for resolving these issues.Expanding into new services is related to wha t Bresnahan and Trajtenberg 1995 call coinvention, the complementary invention which makes advances in general purpose technology valuable inparticular places at particular points in time see also Helpman 1998. As with Augereau and Greenstein2000, this study implements a simple and practical empirical identification strategy for analyzing thedeterminants of coinvention. This strategy builds on Bresnahan and Greenstein 1997 and Brynolffsonand Hitt 1997, which used variation in user characteristics to empirically examine how coinventionprocesses influenced information technology user behavior. Unlike those papers, this study focuses onvariation in suppliers behavior and relates it to attempts to build viable organizations for new markets. Inthis sense, this study is the first to classify or analyze the determinants of coinvention from third partysuppliers in Internet technology markets.Finally, this study also takes steps toward empirically measuring the determinants of what studiesof organizations label mediation services in fluid environments or changes to the boundary of the firm inuncertain environments e.g., Demsetz 1988, Spulber 1998 and many others. Accordingly, this studyalso borrow themes from many classic studies of organization adaptation, diffusion and learning, such asthose by Griliches 1957, Rosenberg 1977, Nelson and Winter 1982 and many others.2. The Internet Access Business after Commercialization Internet technology is not a single invention, diffusing across time and space without changingform. Instead, it is a suite of communication technologies, protocols and standards for networkingbetween computers. This suite is not valuable by itself. It obtains economic value in combination with 2complementary invention, investment and equipment.1 The NSF officially commercialized the Internet backbone in 1992. By 1993 the Internetconnected more than one million hosts, though lack of a userfriendly interface meant that its use wasconfined largely to sophisticated users in scientific, educational, and military institutions. The World Wide Web protocol, allowing easy exchange of data between computers using a graphical interface,began a few years earlier with the invention of the URL and html. Browser software became available in 1993 beginning with Mosaic, the ancestor and model for Netscape, Internet Explorer and other browsers.Commercial Internet Service Providers have been around at least since 1994 Boardwatch, 1994,employing technical refinements developed over many years at academic modem pools and commercialbulletin boards. In the early years it was possible to run a small ISP on a shoestring in either an urban ora rural area. These firms were devoted primarily to dialup. However, this changed as the industry grew atan explosive pace. Consequently, by the summer of 1998, the time of this study, there were dozens ofwellknown national networks and scores of lessknown national providers covering a wide variety ofdialup and direct access. There were also thousands of regional and local providers of Internet access thatserved as the links between endusers and the Internet backbone See Downes and Greenstein 1999 fordetail. Over 92% of the US population had low cost access to commercial ISPs. This explosion of entrants and the resulting geographic pervasiveness came about becausetechnology did not serve as a barrier to entry, nor were there prohibitive costs to hiring mainstreamprogramming talent. Providing basic access required a modem farm, one or more servers to handleregistration and other traffic functions, and a connection to the Internet backbone.2 Some familiarity withthe nonproprietary standards of the web was required, but not difficult to obtain. Because so manystudents had used the technology in school, and because the standards were nonproprietary, anyone withsome experience could use them or at least learn them quickly. As a result, a simple dialup service wasinexpensive to operate and a web page was quite easy to develop. Hence, many entrepreneurs took to thetechnology. So too did many personnel from incumbent firms in related markets, such as bulletin boardsoperators and personnel in computing services.3. Determinants of Business Models in TechnologyIntensive Markets Standard economic analysis offers a number of explanations for why different firms might offerdifferent arrays of services. As emphasized in Bresnahan, Stern and Trajtenberg 1997, one way to framesuch a question is to view it as an attempt to differentiate from common competitors in order to createrents. In that study PC firms try to push technical frontiers, develop local or national brand names or 1 For more on the commercialization of the Internet, see Greenstein 2000a.2 For example, see the description in Kalakota and Whinston 1996, Lieda 1997, the accumulated discussionon www.amazing.comInternetfaq.txt, http:www.isps.com, or Kolstad 1998 at www.bsdi.com.3combine recent technical advances with less technical businesses in unique ways. Such differentiationmay arise as a response to firmspecific assets or other competitive factors, and these returns may betemporary if competitors eventually learn to provide close substitutes.A similar line of reasoning appears frequently in ISP trade publications, where analystsdistinguish between two types of activities other than basic access, technically difficult access andcomplementary services. Accordingly, this is one approach to modeling differentiation.cid:31 Offering technically difficult access: Highbandwidth applications present many technicalissues which challenge the skills and capital constraints of many ISPs. The slow diffusion ofcommercially viable highspeed access markets is widely regarded as a major bottleneck to thedevelopment of the next generation of Internet technologies.cid:31 Offering services that are complementary to basic access: Providing additional servicesbecame essential for retaining or attracting a customer base. Many ISPs instead tried to develop additionalservices, such as filtering, hosting, webdesign services and network maintenance for businesses. Some ofthese were quite costly, as they had to be properly assembled, maintained, and marketed. Many of theseservices push the boundaries of existing telecommunications and computing market definitions.What service will an ISP offer? The discussions in Berry 1992, which examined airline entryinto new routes, provides useful guidance for empirically modeling entry into markets in which a firm hasnot previously competed. Firms may choose to expand into one, some or all possible markets; Berryposits that the presence of a firm in a market indicates positive expected profitability to offering service.A similar insight applies to this setting. For many ISPs, much of the equipment and RD associated withestablishing basic access facilities was already sunk. Expanding the scope of those facilities beyond basicaccess into a new service involved further expenses. Considerable commercial uncertainty surrounds theultimate value of such expansion. Achieving minimum efficient scale was an important concern for ISPswith small customer bases, so too was finding economies of scope with existing services. Despite thisuncertainty, one can interpret presence as a signal of positive expected profitability to offering service.Suttons 1991 theory of endogenous sunk costs also highlights a related consideration. If largescale sunk investments lead to firmspecific demand expansion and if providers find economies of scopeacross these services, then the market can only support a small number of providers. The open questionconcerns the geographic scope of these Sutton economies. If these arise at a national level, then thenumber of national providers will be small. However, if thousands of geographically dispersed ISPs findeconomies of scope between Internet access and a line of service with locationspecific elements, thenproviders at a local level could survive Sutton economies at the national level. That is, national serviceand local service may remain imperfect substitutes in the eyes of some users and the market could retain amix of local and national firms. The open question is whether there is any evidence of economies of scopebetween locationsspecific service and ISP line of business.4By the time of this study AOL, ATT, MindspringEarthlink, and many other ISPs, focused onbuilding large national firms, investing heavily in RD and marketing expenditures. Other ISPs, such asthose with a regional or city focus, deliberately focused on new services which enhance their marketingadvantages at a local level. This study primarily examines the latter actors.How does one empirical investigate which serrvices will a local firm pursue? The theory ofgeneral purpose technologies and coinvention Bresnahan and Trajtenberg 1995, Helpman 1998provides a framework. Differentiation from a common competitor can be understood as an attempt tocustomize a malleable technology to different locations, firms, and time trends. That is, many firms andlocations face the same secular technological trends. Differences across firms at any point in time orover time arise when decision makers face different incentives arising from different demand conditions,different quality of local infrastructure, different richness of labor markets for talent, or different qualityof firm assets. These create a variety of economic incentives for adapting Internet infrastructure to newuses and applications.In summary, existing theory suggests that there should be considerable heterogeneity in thebehavior of ISPs, partly as a reflection of real differences in economic conditions and partly a reflectionof different evaluations of similar, yet uncertain, economic circumstances. Beyond such a generalstatement, theory does not provide specific guidance about which factors were likely to matter most to ISPs decisions, nor does the trade press have anything other than platitudes to guide analysis of whydifference arise. Which factor matters most is an empirical question.In this study, empirical identification rests on comparing the decisions of similar ISPs who facedifferent local conditions. It also rests on contrasting the behavior of ISPs who operate in some locationsbut with different firmspecific constraints. A similar approach was used by Augereau and Greenstein2000, which examines ISP incentives to upgrade the quality of their equipment. This identificationstrategy has its origins in many studies of innovative behavior.cid:31 Firm specific factors: A wellknown line of research about firm behavior in evolving marketsemphasizes the number of firmspecific factors shaping the incentives to bring new technology into useSee, e.g., Demsetz 1988 or Nelson and Winter 1977 for a summary. In this instance, ISPs came tothe new opportunities with different skills, experiences and commercial focus. In the face of considerablefirmspecific commercial uncertainty, ISPs purchased and installed their own capital equipment,publicized brand and service agreements, and made other longlasting investments. Many of theseinvestments could commit the ISP to a particular array of services, even before market demand wasrealized or new commercial opportunities were recognized. Many such investments also foster economiesof scope across old and new services or between clusters of new services.cid:31 Location specific factors: Another wellknown line of economic research, dating at least to Griliches 1957, has emphasized the geographic dispersion of the determinants of incentives to adopt 5new technology. Geographic variation arises for many reasons. For example, while basic dialup access iswidely available in all urban areas and many rural areas, there is great variance in market structure on alocal level. Some areas have low densities, precluding data services which require a minimum scale.Dense urban areas contain more suppliers from a wide variety of backgrounds, while less dense areascontain few suppliers, fostering differences in competitive pressures. In addition, many ISPs deliberatelycustomize frontier technology to the needs of enterprises doing business at a specific time in a specificplace, trying to establish longlasting relationships with a nearby customer base. The costs and benefits ofthis approach may vary by region. Infrastructure differs by regions, so too does demand, as sophisticatedusers are unevenly distributed across geographic regions.4. Data To characterize the offering of service in a quantitative way, some research assistants and I examined the business lines of 3816 Internet service providers in the United States who advertise onthelist.3 This site, maintained by Meckler Media, provides the opportunity for both large and small ISPsto advertise their services. ISPs fill out a questionnaire where the answers are partially formatted, then theanswers are displayed in a way that allows users to compare different ISP services. Greenstein 2000bexamines all 3816 ISPs. This study examines 2089 small and medium sized ISPs. For these ISPs it ispossible to identify both firm and location specific determinants.4A. Generating the Sample By construction every firm in the sample provides some amount of dialup or directaccess and basic functionality, such as email accounts, shell accounts, IP addresses, new links, FTP and Telnet capabilities. It contains many observations from ISPs in rural areas and from virtually all themainstream ISPs. These ISPs, however, underrepresent ISPs in small towns e.g., where advertising onthe web is not necessary and quasipublic ISPs e.g., rural telephone companies. In addition, thissample does not examine firms who offer nonbasic services but who do not offer basic access.5The sample is comprised of small firms so I could identify local conditions for each firm.To construct the dataset I first restricted the sample to 3300 ISPs found in 20 or fewer area codes, wherethis latter variable comes from thelist. This isolates regionally dispersed decision makers. Second, thesample was compared against approximately 5400 ISPs in the Downes and Greenstein 1999 who were 3 For details see the Appendices, which are listed on the web page for the Journal of Industrial Economics.4 Results for all 3816 ISPs use fewer covariates about location and are not substantively different. However, theseestimates do contain an additional insight about size. See Appendix I on the JIE web site.5 As noted in Downes and Greenstein 1999, there is also a subtle empirical bias in any study of ISPs. Allinferences in this sample are conditional on observing the ISP in the access business. We do not observe those whoconsidered this business, but did not choose it.6in five or fewer counties. Why five or fewer counties? Counties are a less coarse way to identify localservice territories and local market conditions than the next best alternative, using the area codes includedin thelist.6 In practice, the Downes and Greenstein 1999 dataset for small ISPs comes from 1998springsummer listings in thedirectory, another forum in which ISPs advertise. Thedirectory placesemphasis on listing the local dialup phone numbers for many ISPs,7 which permits identification of thelocal points of presence POPs for ISPs, and, hence, the local geographic territories served by any ISPwho offers dialup service.8The data set emphasizes accuracy over increases in sample size. An ISP was included inthe sample if the ISP listed the same domain name for the home page in both thedirectory and thelist.9Since the dataset is large enough for the statistical purposes below and there was no hope of getting acensus of all ISPs, the benefits of absolute accuracy overwhelmed the potential risks of being inaccuratefor a few firms.10These 2089 ISPs is not a complete census of small ISPs, but it is a random sample ofsmall ISPs. Comparisons of the 2089 ISPs in the analysis sample with the roughly 5400 small ISPs in Downes and Greenstein 1999 showed little difference in the features of the service territories. Forexample, in the sample 83.5% of the ISPs are in urban counties, using the broadest definition of urbanfrom the US Census. In Downes and Greenstein, only 81.1% are in urban counties. Other than this slightdifference, there is no qualitative difference in the average features of the territories covered by small ISPs in the two data sets. Moreover, the number of small ISPs found in each county in the Downes and Greenstein dataset and in the sample correlates at .94, as one would expect if the 2089 ISPs were nearly arandom selection.11 Differences between this sample and a sample of national firms are highlighted in 6 In some dense urban counties, the number of area codes exceeds the number of counties, but for most of thecountry the number of counties vastly exceeds the number of area codes. There are over 3000 counties in the US andless than 200 area codes.7 The other source of data for Downes and Greenstein 1999 is the Boardwatch backbone list, which concentratesmostly on national ISPs Boardwatch 1998.8 This is an artifact of the US local telephone system, which tends to charge telephone calls by distance. Hence, thelocation of a local phone number from an ISP is an excellent indicator of the local geographic territory covered bythe ISP. See Downes and Greenstein 1999 for further detail.9 It was discovered that it is relatively common for several different firms to maintain similar company names andsimilar domain names, heightening potential confusion. In addition, many ISPs maintain several similar homepages with different domain addresses for a variety of reasons e.g., tracking traffic from different sources,marketing under different organizational umbrellas, etc 10 Because two sets of company names are maintained by two completely unrelated lists, thedirectory and thelist,each of whom uses different abbreviations and possibly different domain names, many ambiguities arose. It iscertainly the case that many of the 1300 firms from thelist which are not included in the analysis sample are, in fact,in the Downes and Greenstein 1999 data. However, verifying these matches was tedious and potentially subjective,rendering it almost infeasible.11 The correlation between the ISPs per county in the two datasets is .94 when Downes and Greenstein 1999 onlyexamine ISPs in five counties or less. The correlation is, not surprisingly, lower when we correlate the number of ISPs in the analysis sample per county with the entire Downes and Greenstein dataset, which includes all nationaland regional firms. In this case, the correlation is .82. This is because larger firms tend to disproportionately locate 7Greenstein 2000b.Figure 1 presents a map where a county is blackened if it contains at least one ISP fromthe analysis sample. There are 905 such counties represented in this sample, with representatives fromvirtually every urban area in the US as well as several hundred rural counties.B. Classifying the Services of ISPs The first goal is to classify the activities of Internet access firms. No product code existsfor this industry, as it has grown faster than government statistical agencies can classify it. Anyclassification system for an evolving industry will necessarily reflect the judgement of contemporarytrade literature. As in Bresnahan, Stern and Trajtenberg 1997, some points of differentiation, such asbeing on a frontier, are necessarily defined in a way that eventually becomes dated. This will also be trueof some of the complementary services, particularly those related to electronic commerce, which arerapidly changing at the time. Based on contemporary magazines, I grouped services into five broadcategories: basic access, frontier access, networking, hosting, and web page design. These broadcategories provide a feasible and consistent view of economic activity of ISPs, emphasizing whichactivities push out frontier access and which provide services complementary to access. Since only coarseinformation was available about the characteristics of demand, these categories generally reflectcontemporary suppliers view of how activities should be grouped together. See Appendix III for thecomplete description and Table 1 for a general outline.cid:31 Basic access constitutes any service slower than and including a T1 line, includingfractional T1. Many of the technologies inherited from the precommercial days were classified ascomplimentary to basic access, not as a new service.cid:31 Frontier access includes any access faster than a T1 line, which is becoming the normfor highspeed access to a business user. It also includes ISPs which offer direct access for resale to other ISPs or datacarriers, that is, it also includes ISP, who offer parts of their own backbone as a resale toothers.12cid:31 Networking involves activities associated with enabling Internet technology at a userslocation. All ISPs do a minimal amount of this as part of their basic service in establishing connectivity.However, an extensive array of these services, such as regular maintenance, assessment of facilities,emergency repair, and so on, are often essential to retaining business customers. Note, as well, that someof these experimental services could have been in existence prior to the diffusion of Internet access; it is in urban areas.12 Speed is the sole dimension for differentiating between frontier and basic access. This is a practical choice. Thereare a number of other access technologies just now becoming viable, such as wireless access, which are slow buttechnically difficult. Only a small number of firms in this data are offering these services and these are coincidentwith offering high speed access.8their offering by Internet access firms that makes them a source of differentiation from other ISPs. cid:31 Hosting is typically geared toward a business customer, especially those establishingvirtual retailing sites. This requires the ISP to store and maintain information for its access customers onthe ISPs servers. Again, all ISPs do a minimal amount of hosting as part of basic service, even forresidential customers e.g., for email. However, some ISPs differentiate themselves by making a largebusiness of providing an extensive array of hosting services, including information provision, siteanalysis tools, and some services related to the conduct of electronic commerce.cid:31 Web Design may be geared toward either the home or business user. Again, many ISPsoffer some passive assistance or help pages on web page design and access. However, some offeradditional extensive consulting services, design custom sites for their users, provide services associatedwith design tools and web development programs. Most charge fees for this additional service.Other services were put into four other groups: traditional computing services e.g., PCsales and service, traditional telecommunications e.g., cellular phone sales and service, consulting, andmiscellaneous services e.g., copying, cafes and photography. While in practice these last four were lesscommon, the nonaccess lines of business of ISPs are revealing. For the most part, if an ISP advertisesthis business service, this was this firms primary business before the firm became an ISP.Once again, accuracy took precedent over other considerations. I will only record aservice line if the ISP clearly states it as such . In practice, descriptions of each ISPs services on thelistwas classified into standard phrases which are then mapped to particular services at particular ISPs. Inother words, an ISP offers networking services if that ISP uses one of the phrases which corresponds tonetworking activity. Similar exercise followed for hosting, web design and frontier access. In general,these methods should undercount the offering of any particular service line since many phrases wereuninformative.13 In addition, the lines between different services are often, but not always, sharp. Thiswarrants a cautious interpretative approach, because ambiguities in definitions naturally arise.Table 1 lists the most common phrases for each line of business.14 By definition, every ISP has at least one useful phrase indicating activity in the access business. An ISP could be no serviceother than basic access, one other service or more than one. On average, an ISP had 8.6 useful phrasesstandard deviation of 4.6, maximum of 40. The main statistical findings from applying the classificationscheme are listed in Table 1. 13 The approach depended on the ISP describing in concrete terms the businesses they offer. For example, noadditional line of business was assigned to a ISP who advertised Call for details or We are a friendly firm. Thevast majority of unused phrases were idiosyncratic phrases which only appeared once with one firm, defying generalcharacterization. There were 1105 such phrases and 6,795 unique useful phrases, which occurred 1406 times outof 35,436 total phrases. In other words, most of the unused phrases occurred only once and described attributes ofthe firms which had nothing to do with their lines of business e.g., HQ phone number, contact information ormarketing slogans. The most common unused phrase was etc.14 The entire list of phrases and the correspondence table are available from the author on request.9C. The Service Lines of ISPs Tables 1 and 2 present statistics for experimentation by ISPs in the sample. Of the 2089firms in the sample, 1260 60% have at least one line of business other than basic dialup or direct Internet access. Table 1 shows that 514 provide high speed access, 440 networking, 460 web hosting, 757web page design. For such a cautious method, this reveals quite a lot of nonaccess services by firms inthe access business.15Table 2 examines the two different types of services other than basic access. Specializingin very highspeed Internet services is one type of service that distinguishes a firm from its competitors.As has been noted in many places e.g., Kolakota and Whinston 1996, greater and greater speeds areharder to obtain as a technical matter and costly to reliably provide as a commercial matter. Incontrast, specializing in hosting, networking service or web design can also distinguish a firm from itscompetitors. Many of these services require trained personnel and may be difficult to do profitably.Hence, these two types of differentiation might be done by the same firms for commercial reasons, butthere is no technical reason for it.The fraction of firms in networking, hosting, and web design is higher among those withhigh speed access, but the relationship is not very strong. Of the 514 in high speed access, 314 61%provided networking, hosting or web design. By comparison, of the 1575 not providing highspeedaccess, 200 12.6% did so. Similarly, of the 1050 providing networking, hosting or web design services,314 30% provided high speed access. Of the 1039 not providing networking, hosting and web design,200 19.2% provided high speed access.Further comparisons of different lines of business are in Greenstein 2000b. Thesereinforce the point that different firms carry different nonbasic services. For example, of those withoutfrontier access, 26% have only one new service, 15% have two and 4% have all three. Of those withfrontier access, the propensities are mildly different: 25% have only one new service, 24% have two, and 10% have all three. No obvious pattern governs their combination or clusters of services. Table 1 shows the contrast between urban and rural areas. 1764 ISPs primarily serveurban areas.16 Of the 1764 ISPs, 26.9% offer frontier access, 22.9% offer networking services, 23.5%offer hosting services, and 38.6% offer web design services. Of the 325 ISPs primarily found in ruralareas, 12.0% offer frontier access, 11.0% offer networking services, 13.8% offer hosting, and 23.3% offer 15 One of the most difficult phrases to classify was general consulting i.e., consulting which did not refer to aspecific activity. Of all these vague consulting cases, all but 12 arose in the 1836 firms who provide networking,hosting and web design. Hence, the vast majority of consulting activity is accounted for by the present classificationmethods as one of these three complementary activities.16 Each county an ISP serves is designated urban or rural by the US census. In the rare cases where an ISP serves amix of urban and rural areas, if the majority of counties are urban, then an ISP is said to be urban.10web design services. The propensities for rural ISPs are between 40% and 60% lower in each categorycategory. A test for difference of means between urban and rural ISPs rejects the hypothesis that thepropensity is the same between the urban and rural samples of ISPs. This holds for every type of activity.These first results do not seem to be an artifact of survey bias. There is not enoughevidence here to suggest something artificial about the relationship between the results and the effort ittakes to fill out the survey from for thelist.175. The Determinants of NonBasic Services The above test is an unconditional comparison and says little about the determinants ofoutcomes. These findings do not control for urbanrural differences in population demographics, nor forurbanrural differences in firmspecific traits. In other words, the geographic dispersion of the endogenousvariable might be explained by geographic factors, but it might also be explained by the geographicdistribution of firmspecific factors. A careful inference requires an econometric model which measuresthe influence of firmspecific and locationspecific determinants.A. Model Selection Table 3 includes summary statistics for all endogenous and exogenous variables, asdefined below. In the discussion below, the matrix of these variables will be listed as X, where Xirepresents a vector of variables for observation i. Let i index ISPs where i 1 through 2089. Let Yni 1if an ISP offers networking and zero otherwise. Let Yhi, Ywi, and Yfi be defined similarly for hosting, webdesign and frontier access. These activities will be the subcomponents for alternative specifications ofthe endogenous variable.Several considerations determine the selection of an empirical model. First, the activityof interest offering nonaccess service lines is never directly observed. At best, it is observed witherror, as represented by Yni, Yhi, Ywi, and Yfi. Second, the best available measure of this activity isdiscrete.18 Third, due to the datacollection method, the boundary definition for activity is subject tomeasurement and classification error. Hence, the econometric method should characterize tendencieswhich do not depend on slight changes in the definition of activity. Fourth, the econometric approachmust use methods which are potentially robust to missing determinants, as well as different data sets. 17 Geographic firm size i.e., the total number of area codes in which the ISP offers service is a good measure of asurvey bias because the ISPs must expend effort to indicate the extent of their geographic coverage. If the number ofphrases was low due to ISP impatience with the survey format, one would expect a strong relationship between firmsize and the number of phrases. Since the correlation is positive but small, which is plausible for many reasonshaving nothing to do with survey bias, I conclude that the numbers of lines of business does not arise as an artifactof ISP impatience with the survey or other forms of laziness by the ISP.18 It is also possible to coarsely measure whether an ISP offers any service, offers a few simple variations on it, oroffers many different services. For reasons discussed below, these were not useful.11Since this is the first analysis of this data, it focuses on questions which characterize basicpatterns. Below I employ and contrast two related approaches:ni, Y hi, and Y Let Yni, Yhi, are Ywi, be determined by distinct but related processes. Accordingly, there are three continuous latentvariables, Ywi, which determine the choices to perform each of these nonbasic activities.Let Yni cid:31i Xi Bn cid:31ni describe the latent variable. Let similar relationships hold for the other twoactivities. Here cid:31 is a random variable which is common to each activity but varies across ISPs withinthe panel. This captures an underlying and unobservable disposition to perform nonaccess services,reflecting underlying demand, entrepreneurial vision and competitive conditions which are common todifferent activities at the same ISP.19cid:31 A bivariate probit between frontier access and the complementary services: Letthe endogenous variables reflect values shown in Table 2. For frontier access let Yfi equal one if the ISPoffers frontier access, and zero otherwise. For the other variable, an ISP gets a value of one if it offers atleast one complementary service among networking, hosting and web design. More precisely, define Yci 0 when Yni, Yhi, and Ywi, all equal zero. In all other cases Y be the latent endogenousvariables. Then let Yci cid:31c Xi Bc cid:31ci, where cid:31f and cid:31c are potentiallycorrelated.fi cid:31f Xi Bf cid:31fi and Yci 1. Let Yfi Both approaches focus on understanding the determinants of each service. Afterconsiderable exploration in early versions of this study, it was found that most of the importance ofdifferent determinants can be characterized with these two straightforward models.20 Future work willexplore related questions associated with the incentives to perform different combinations of activitiesand the capacity of local markets to only support a maximum number of entrants.21B. Exogenous variables A full explanation for each variable is included in Appendix II.cid:31 The firm specific factors generally measure attributes that tend to cluster together,partly due to economies of scope and partly due to firm focus on particular markets. EXPERIENCE is adummy which takes on a value of one if the ISP was listed in thedirectory in the spring of 1997, more 19 Note that the correlation of the errors in this setting is, at best, only a weak test of whether the services offeringsare complementary see e.g., Athey and Stern 1998 for discussion.20 Early versions of this study explored many variations on these specifications with little additional insight. Earlyversion also examined the extent of nonbasic access activity, counting the number of different services an ISPoffered. I estimated both ordered probit and a negative binomial models. The results resembled the any serviceside of the bivariate probit. Hence, I show the simpler econometric results.21 Downes and Greenstein 1999 do take this approach to understanding ISP entry, but this paper cannot use thesame approach since, due to concerns about accuracy, this paper uses a data set which is an incomplete census of allthe ISPs who offer new services.12than a year earlier than the survey in thelist. Since there were roughly two thousand new entrants in 1997and 1998, this dummy measures whether a firm was an early entrant into the ISP business.COMMUNICATIONS and COMPUTER take on the value one if the ISP lists another line of businessrelated to nonTCPIP based communicationscomputers e.g., typically a retail outlet for purchases orservice. MISCBUSINESS takes on one if the ISP maintains another nonTCPIP business line e.g,retail outlet for photocopies or a cafe. HANDHOLDING measures whether an ISP is trying to makebasic access technology e.g., email, filtering, downloading, name registration easy to use for some ofits customers. It counts the number of times an ISP advertises its ability to do these simple things see Appendix III for precise definition. Since these were activities which a technical user alreadyunderstands, an ISP did this to attract a nontechnical customer. DIALUP takes on the value one when an ISP offers any dialup service; its absence indicates an exclusive focus on business customers.DEDICATED takes on one if the ISP offers any direct access; its absence indicates an exclusive focus onresidential customers.22 The geographic reach of an ISP is measured in two ways. ONEAREACODEtakes on the value one if the ISP maintains service in only one area code, as indicated in thelist.23 Anadditional measure of size, ONECOUNTY, takes on the value one if the ISP maintains service in onlyone county, as indicated in thedirectory.cid:31 Locationspecific factors are exogenous to the firm. Early specifications includedvariables similar to those found in Augereau and Greenstein 2000, which examined a different sampleof ISPs and their upgrade behavior from a year earlier. This included measurement of demographicfeatures of areas, infrastructure, competitiveness and the presence of universities in the county in whichthe ISP provides service. In early estimates many of these were not statistically different from zero,mostly due to multicollinearity with other locationspecific variables in this dataset. For brevity, thesecoefficients are dropped in favor of URBAN and FRACPROF. See the Appendix II for detail.URBAN reflects the percentage of urban counties in which the ISP offers local dialupservice or maintains a headquarters. URBAN, by itself, supports several interpretations. This variable isnot identifiably different from local market competitiveness, density of available customers for a fixedfirm size, and the quality of local infrastructure i.e., ISPs in urban markets face more competitive 22 Both DIALUP and DEDICATED are, arguably, endogenous from an econometric standpoint, as these aredecisions which may have been made at the same time as the decisions to experiment in frontier access andcomplementary services. To test whether the estimates are sensitive to their inclusion, I tried specifications with andwithout them and found that the estimates did not dramatically change. Hence, I only show the estimates with thesevariables included.23 When examining the entire data set, where locationspecific data is not available, I also use MORETHAN20, adummy variable for presence in more than 20 area codes, indicative of national coverage. See Appendix I estimatesfor entire sample. However, as noted in Downes and Greenstein 1999, national coverage necessarily implies thatthe ISP has located its POPs in urban areas; that is, virtually every national ISP offers services in the top 50 cities ofthe US. Thus, there is little measurable geographic variation between large firms and little variation in localconditions. 13settings, can reach more users for the same investment, and generally have access to better infrastructure.Next, FRACPROF describes the fraction of the population in white collar work see Downes and Greenstein 1999. This ostensibly measures local differences in demand, though, once again, thisvariable supports several interpretations. FRACPROF is not identifiably different from otherdemographic measures in a region. Areas with higher FRACPROF tend to have populations which havehigher income, more education, more whitecollar work and more PCs at home and at work.cid:31 The distribution of factors between urbanrural locations: FRACPROF coincidespartially with urbanrural in that it has a mean value of .41 for ISPs in urban counties, and a value of .32for ISPs in rural counties. This is quite interesting since it can identify urbanrural differences which arisedue to demand instead of other factors, such as competitiveness and density. 24A related pattern also arises in some of the firmspecific variables. There is more handholding in urban ISPs 1.03 vs .64 on average, more experience with computing .01 versus .006, andmore experience with other business .012 versus .008. There are also differences in dedicatedinvestments .90 versus .93. These differences raise the possibility that the distribution of firmspecificfactors among urbanrural areas will explain behavior instead of the urbanrural variable by itself.This discussion also motivates a similar comparison between the general features of thefirmspecific variables for the local ISPs in urban areas and larger ISPs, who are excluded by design.Larger ISPs locate most of their points of presence in urban areas. Interestingly, no differences werefound between the firmspecific variable means or variances for large ISPs or small ISPs in urban areas.This suggests that some of the inferences about small ISP in urban areas may apply equally well to large ISPs who are otherwise similar and located in similar urban areas.256. Results Table 4 presents estimates for the models. The first, second and third columns are thetrivariate model and the last two columns are the bivariate probit.The absence of a dialup capability reveals an ISP that focuses on a business market,while the absence of a dedicated capability reveals an ISP who focuses on a residential market. Hence, toavoid including perfect predictors of frontier access i.e., no business focus no frontier access andcomplementary services i.e., no dialup complimentary service, DEDICATED is dropped from thefrontier part of the bivariate probit, and DIALUP is dropped from the complimentary side of the bivariateprobit and all the estimates in the trivariate probit.In addition, earlier specifications tested whether the reporting date on thelist influenced 24 These populations do not differ in the standard deviations both are approx .055, but they do differ in theirminima .17 vs .22 and maxima .49 and .59.25 Additionally, it suggests that differences in the coefficient estimates for URBAN and national presence areinformative about the effect of size on ISP behavior. See Appendix I for estimates for entire sample.14results and found no evidence of any reporting bias.26 As it reduces the sample size, it is not reported inthe specification.A. Description of findings DIALUP is negative in the frontier part of the trivariate probit, as expected. The absenceof a commercial dialup service indicates a business focus and a high likelihood of offering frontier directaccess business services. It is a large estimate; only one other dummy variable predicts as well seebelow. However, only 2% of the sample has no dialup capability, so it is a good predictor for only asmall number of cases. DEDICATED is positive and significant in the complementary activity part of thebivariate, indicating that the investment in some dedicated capabilities predicts more new services. Itparticularly matters for networking and web design, but not hosting. Since almost 10% of the sample hasno dedicated capability, it is a good predictor for a relatively large number of cases.HANDHOLDING is a positive and significant predictor of new services includingfrontier access. However, HANDHOLDING is qualitatively unimportant in the frontier probit, consistentwith the interpretation that it captures the marketing focus of the ISP and not just its propensity to talk.HANDHOLDING matters for all the complementary services, with slightly higher estimates for hostingservices. As its mean value is close to one, variance in HANDHOLDING is not too important except atextreme values. HANDHOLDING is a qualitatively important predictor for the 10% of ISPs with valuesabove 3 . In other words, firms who are willing to make the effort to extensively explain even their basicaccess services are more likely to also offer complementary services. This is good evidence that manycommercial firms are consciously trying to bridge the gap between the technical frontier and the needs ofthe less technically sophisticated commercial users.The related lines of business predict an ISP willingness to experiment with new Internetservices. COMMUNICATIONS, COMPUTERS, and MISCBUSINESS are positive statisticallysignificant coefficients on one half of the bivariate probit but not the other. Only COMMUNICATIONSmatters for the frontier side of the probit. In other words, experience in any other line of business is agood predictor of more new services in at least one type of complementary service, but only business incommunications influences experimentation with high speed access. This is consistent with expectationsand quite sensible. The trivariate probit reveals some interesting differences among the threecomplimentary services. All three factors predict the offering of networking services, COMPUTERS and MISCBUSINESS predict web design, only COMPUTERS predicts the offering of hosting.COMPUTERS is more than twice as large as either of the other two dummy variables in 26 Thelist requires the ISP to provide the day of its last update. Some ISPs clearly update their informationfrequently, while a few had not done so in over a year. I tested for whether the most recently reported informationcontained more reported services, even controlling for other factors, and found no evidence of such.15the bivariate estimates, while COMMUNICATIONS contributes much more to providing frontier access.COMPUTERS particular contributes to the offering of networking services and web design services.Again, this is consistent with expectations, a firm or entrepreneur that was selling or repairing PCsbefore the commercialization of the Internet is quite likely to expand their business into basic Internetaccess and related lines of services, such as network maintenance, hosting and web design, but notnecessarily high speed access. The one limit to all these inferences is that COMPUTERS,COMMUNICATION and MISCBUSINESS take on values of one for only a small percentage of the ISPs, so their predictive power only works for a small part of the sample of ISPs. This finding isconsistent with an important role for previous experience linked to the experience of a firm in a particularproduct market. The coefficient on EXPERIENCE is insignificant in all estimates except the estimatesfor networking. Even in that case the coefficient is not very large .22, so time in business is not animportant factor in this market.ONEAREACODE is a negative predictor of experimentation in all estimates, though theestimate is never large. ONECOUNTY suggests some interesting qualifications to that conclusion. An ISP who is in only one county is even less likely to offer frontier access. Together these are large .58.18.76, reinforcing the importance of size as a predictor of offering this service. This result contrastswith the estimates for complementary services. The trivariate probit shows that ONECOUNTY makes an ISP more likely to offer networking services. The coefficient is not very large .21, so it is only weakevidence of the possibility that localspecific factors may influence some repair and maintenance servicesfor networking. ONECOUNTY is not different from zero for hosting or web design.27The estimate of URBAN is not significant except in the networking probit, and even thiscoefficient is not very large .16. These are striking estimates because they contradict the hypothesis that URBAN location induces entry into frontier access. Moreover, they differ from the simple inference donewith the unconditional data.Along with ONECOUNTY, the coefficient on URBAN is, at best, weak evidence that theprovision of networking differs from hosting and webdesign. More concretely, an early entrantEXPERIENCE1 into the ISP business who is only located in a single ONEAREACODE1 urbanURBAN1 area is also likely to be in only one county ONECOUNTY1.28 It is more likely to offer 27 To further test for importance of location on size, scale and density effects, URBAN was interacted with ONECOUNTY and ONEAREACODE. That is, an ISP in one urban county can reach more people than an ISP inone rural county. Also, an ISP in one urban area codes covers a smaller geographic territory than an ISP in one ruralarea code. This respecification mildly influenced the estimates, showing that small ISPs in urban areas were morelikely to offer frontier access than small ISPs in rural areas. However, it did not lead to any other inferences for theother services. Hence, the simpler specification is shown.28 One area code is a good predictor of one county. 88% of the 1067 ISPs in one area code are only in one county.Naturally, the converse is not as strong. Because most major dense urban areas have multiple area codes, only 56%16networking services .21.22.16.28.31 than an inexperienced, rural ISP that is spreading serviceamong counties and area codes. Yet, at best, this is weak evidence of a difference between networkingand the other complementary services due to the small coefficient estimates.The evidence for the importance of locationspecific factors is mixed at best.FRACPROF is statistically significant in the estimates for frontier access, networking and web design,but not hosting. However, the size of the coefficients is relatively small. Only large swings in theexogenous variables, on the order of several standard deviations, influence any of the results to animportant degree. In other words, an ISP located in an area with an extremely high fraction ofprofessionals e.g., .50, as compared with an ISP in an area with a extremely low fraction e.g., .25, ismore likely to offer frontier access .251.37.34, web design .40, and especially networking .62.This is important, to be sure, but only at the extremes. Thus, it is not especially strong determinant formost of the sample.B. Overall Assessment The estimates for the original sample strongly suggest that frontier access and otheractivities are not similar. The estimates lead to a sound rejection of Bf Bc in the bivariate probit,consistent with the modeling decisions to treat these two decisions as interrelated but seperate. Theestimate for the correlation coefficient reinforces this conclusion. It is 0.12 in the bivariate probit,indicating a small positive relationship between the unobserved determinants of experimentation.Such a strong rejection is not possible between the three complimentary services. Allthree share some similar estimates in terms of signs and economic significance, though these similaritiesare stronger between networking and web design than between hosting and the other two. In other words,it is not possible to reject Bn Bw for most of the coefficients, while it is possible to reject a similar testfor a subset of coefficients associated with hosting and the other two services, i.e., Bn Bh or Bw Bh.The estimated correlation of errors contains further information about the similarities in services. In thetrivariate probit, the correlation between the unobserved error in the networking and hosting probit is .16,between hosting and web design .32, and between networking and web design .58. Indeed, .58 is so highas to raise the question of whether the industrys propensity to discuss these services as distinct is relevantas an empirical matter. i.e., EXPERIENCE,COMMUNICATION, ONECOUNTY, URBAN, and FRACPROF to suggest weak evidence ofdifferences between the determinants of these services. However, enough differences emerged From this analysis several conclusions arise. First, there appears to be significant ISPspecific factors which cluster together with the choice to offer new services. In particular, size, of the 1658 ISPs in one county are in only one area code.17geographic scope, key capital investments, focus on particular types of users and nonISP lines ofbusinesses all predict experimentation with new services. Second, frontier access is distinct from anyother type of differentiation, and is weakly influenced by locationspecific factors. Third, while hosting ismore similar to the other services than frontier access, it also has several differences, mostly importantlythat it is influenced by few locationspecific factors. Fourth, networking and web design services havemany similar observed and unobserved determinants, and both appear to be weakly influenced bylocationspecific factors. This seems to indicate a weak tendency for hosting and frontier access tobecome national products, while, in contrast, networking and web design may retain a structure with bothsome national and some local suppliers.In general, variations in locationspecific variables are not as important as variation infirmspecific variables across all the services. Variables measuring other locationspecific features, suchas FRACPROF and URBAN, do influence behavior, but in only a few instances. However, some of thefirmspecific variables whose distribution does vary over geographic space does help explain some ofthe observed variance. This includes HANDHOLDING, COMPUTING, MISCBUSINESS and DEDICATED.29These findings are consistent with the view that small ISPs choose strategies fordifferentiation based on firmspecific growth strategies, limited possibly by nonconvexities arising at alocal level. Basic service has some scale economies arising from capital equipment investment and otherfixed costs on the back end, but these scale economies are not severe because small ISPs rely on existingtelecommunications infrastructure. In contrast, frontier access is scale intensive, requiring higher volumeof use and, therefore, is not profitable without a density of potential users, typically businesses, a situationprevalent in urban areas and only a few rural areas. Networking, hosting and web design require a coremass of business customers to defray the costs of acquiring capital and maintaining sufficient technicalexpertise. These costs are also defrayed by some economies of scope among these services and betweenthese and other lines of business.These observations suggest the industry may obtain a bifurcated size structure in the longrun. Many observers forecast consolidation around a few national providers who find economies of scalein a national service, perhaps consistent with the presence of endogenous sunk costs ala Sutton 1991.However, small ISPs appear to be finding some economies of scope between Internet access and anotherline of service, especially one with local elements such as highspeed access or networking service. Thesefindings suggest that national service and local service may remain imperfect substitutes in the eyes ofusers. In that case, the industry could retain a mix of local and national firms. 29 The data of all 3816 ISPs also finds a large firm bias, consistent with this theme. National coverage and the largesize tend to put firms in urban areas.18C. Differentiation, Density and the Growth in Evolving Markets The structure of the ISP business is shaped by the geographic diversity of local marketsand the heterogeneity of firms who commercialize that technology. This dispersion shapes thecustomization of technology to new users and established businesses. This process is a source of greatpolicy concern Werbach 1997, Esbin 1998, Weinberg 1999, as this relationship shapes the creationand targeting of subsidies associated with new services, such as the Erate program, as proposed in the 1996 Telecommunications Act.30While this data tends to support the view that there is a lower propensity for new servicesin lowdensity areas, any conclusion has to be carefully drawn. While the unconditional data document adifference in the propensity in urban and rural ISPs, the conditional estimates found a less starkrelationship. The estimates highlight the importance of several distinct factors which produce geographicdispersion of outcomes.Urban areas get more new services because of two factors: 1 increased exposure tonational ISPs, who expand their services more often; and 2 the local firms in urban areas possessfeatures that lead them to offer services with propensities similar to the national firms. That is, highdensity areas almost always get some ISP entry, while some low density areas get none or very little.High density areas see an especially large amount of entry because they experience entry from nearly allthe firms with national ambitions. While little or no entry in a low density area virtually precludesavailability of any complement to basic access, high density areas benefit from repeated exposure to many ISPs who offer such services. More entrants will lead to more realized numbers of new services, raisingthe probability of finding one, two or three instances of new services in a specific location.This is particularly evidence in the case when ISPs in urban areas have higherpropensities to offer services, as in this data, because ISPspecific factors are not distributedindependently of geography. There is more handholding in urban ISPs, more experience with computing,more experience with other business, as well as differences in dedicated investments, and differences inthe fraction of the population which is professional. Except for the estimates for the propensity to offernetworking, these other observed factors explain the observed difference better than a simple urbandummy.Yet an important caveat applies. The above models also estimate positive and statisticallysignificant correlations between the unobserved determinants of the ISPs propensity to offer services. 30 If the lower propensity to find new services in lowdensity areas is due to an absence of local firms withappropriate skills, then policies might either induce ISPs to expand from highdensity areas to low density areaswhere they would not otherwise be, or it must induce incentivesvisioninvestments from ISPs who are alreadylocated in lowdensity areas but who would otherwise not choose to offer such services. If, on the other hand, theabsence of new services in lowdensity areas is due to an absence of local demand for these services or the absenceof local infrastructure, subsidies run the risk of not changing the propensity to experiment in such areas. Indeed, inthat case, the subsidy will be wasteful if it induces the offering of services which few want.19This estimated correlation can be a function of unobserved ISPspecific determinants of both activities orunobserved locationspecific determinants of both activities. There is no way to tell which it is. Thus, it ispossible that some of the unconditional differences in the propensity to offer services in urbanruralsettings results from these unobserved locationspecific factors.31 Only if the correlation was zero whichit is not could we rule out the role for locationspecific factors completely.These observations also raise a related and subtle question. The above econometric studyis conditional on entry of an ISP in the first place, treating the ISPs features and its region as statisticallyexogenous. Yet, entry might be a function of some unobserved and historical matching process betweenthe individual employees and founders of the ISP and the local area. For example, low density areas havefewer entrants altogether, leading to fewer providers of access with the ISPspecific factors which lead tononbasic services, resulting in fewer new services. This observation does not undermine the conclusionsabove about the relative importance of ISPspecific factors over locationspecific factors; it simply begsthe question about whether the presence of some ISPspecific factors are exogenous in some dynamic andlong run sense. There are a number of ways for this process to work. For example, it is possible that ISPswho were more inclined to expand in 1998 decided to locate in urban areas in 1996, say in order tohave that option later. This type of decision making could induce the geographic dispersion of ISPspecific factors seen in this data.Hence, it is appropriate to be cautious about inferring causality between firm specificfactors and new services. The tendency of firmspecific factors to cluster together can also result from thepresence of an unobserved third variable, such as entrepreneurial ability, causing both the endogenous andexogenous variable to move together.6. Conclusion Many technology enthusiasts have been waiting for the online revolution for a long time,welcoming the possibilities for new businesses, new services and new types of communications. Now thatit is here, a commercialized Internet may not be precisely what they had in mind. The economic benefitsassociated with new frontier technologies are diffuse, uneven and uncertain. Commercializing the Internetis difficult and adaptation is timeconsuming. Many new services do not employ frontier technology atall. Indeed, much commercialization involves bending basic technology to the needs of unsophisticatedusers, a process that often involves many nontechnical issues. Some locations have access to the latesttechnology from commercial firms and some do not, creating the potential for a digital divide in theprovision of services.Commercializing Internet access gave rise to new business models, new cost structures 31 A number of factors cannot be ruled out, such as locationspecific spillovers across vendors, locationspecificlearning about demand, and other factors operating on a small geographic level.20and new applications. Like any other economic activity, not all firms were alike. Providing accessinvolved a mix of the general technical capabilities and specific circumstances facing a particular firm ina particular place. ISPs customized Internet technologies to the unique needs of users and theirorganizations, solving problems as they arose, tailoring general solutions to idiosyncratic circumstancesand their particular commercial strengths. Sometimes ISPs called this activity consulting, and charged forit separately, sometimes it was included as normal business practices. In either case, it involved thetranslation of general knowledge about Internet technologies into specific applications which yieldedeconomic benefits to endusers. In all cases differences between their offering and their nearestcompetitor raise returns to innovative activity, inducing a variety of services from different ISPs.Viewing the Internet access market in this way helps provide empirical guidelines forunderstanding the variety of new services. Some services were shaped by previous ISP experience, whileothers were mildly responsive to local conditions. The factors which lead small ISPs to offer newservices, such as large geographic scope, previous investments and strategic focus, are disproportionatelyfound in urban areas.This study raises questions about the nexus of industry evolution and organizationalchange. Will this industry retain its structure of small and large firms? How do the economies behindcombinations of new services evolve as firms grow, add capital structures and alter their pricingstrategies? Do handholding activities emerge from investments by firms and how does the local labormarket for related activities, such as computer services, foster its growth? These issues cannot beunderstood without further work on the fundamentals of demand and organizational change in Internetactivities.21References Athey, Susan, and Scott Stern 1998, An Empirical Framework for Testing Theories About Complimentarity in Organizational Design, NBER Working Paper No. 6600, June.Augereau, Angelique and Shane Greenstein 2000, The Need for Speed in Emerging Communications Markets: Upgrades to Advanced Technology at Internet Service Providers.

Sample definitions Basic dialup and direct access were defined as either 1 dialup access at speeds of 56k and slower or 2direct access using T1 lines and slower. Since almost all ISPs offer dialup services and direct access tobusinesses,32 an ISP was defined as providing frontier access when it offered T3, DSL, OC3, OC12, and any accessrate above 1056k, and this included technologies that obtained such speeds with cable modems or wirelesstechnologies.Next I define networking services, hosting services and web design services, all of which arecomplementary to basic access. An ISP providing networking services, provides networking equipment oncustomer premises, WAN equipment, colocation networking services, LAN equipment, maintenance services,backup services, networking software or groupware. Hosting includes generic hosting services personal, businessand tailored services anonymous ftp, bulletin boards, etc  Web page development includes basic webfunctionality, active pages, design services, editing tools, security and firewall development, ecommerce design, orintegration of web technology with a companys network.Next, two research and I assistants examined all 3816 ISPs own advertisements about their lines ofbusiness. This method leaves room for judgement. When in doubt, I followed industry norms today, as representedin various industry technical dictionaries and online guides to technology. This approach has the virtue that it isreplicable e.g., the spread sheet describing this correspondence is available on request. It has the drawback that itrequired a novel Internet access standard industry classification scheme, analogous to the more familiar SIC codein GDP accounting, which requires some educated guesses about how to classify business lines.33In total, my research assistants and I identified 6,795 unique phrases, many of which occurred repeatedly.Counting the repeats, a total of 35,436 such phrases were identified.34 Since these phrases are selfreported by the ISPs, few norms organized the presentation of most phrases except for a few important exceptions.35 We employedthe common meaning of industry terms and then determined the line of business they represented, according to thecategories listed above e.g., frontier access, networking, hosting, web design, etc. All classifications used onlydisplayed information, ascribing a line of business to an ISP when the determination was unambiguous andthrowing out the phrase otherwise. We were able to use 96% of all the phrases which appeared that is, 34,030 ofthem. 36B. Exogenous Variables COMMUNICATIONS and COMPUTER are dummies which take on one if the ISP lists another line ofbusiness related to communicationscomputers and which does not use TCPIP technology. I presume that an ISPwho satisfies this requirement comes to the ISP business with prior experience in business lines other than Internet 32 As it turned out, it is the case that 3697 of the 3816 ISPs listed some type of basic dialup service, while 3372listed some type of basic direct access business. And every single ISP listed at least one of these. This initial findingfurther motivates the baseline comparison for frontier access.33 The issue in this type of work is over whether to group products and services together based on whether they arecomplementssubstitutes in production or complementssubstitutes in demand. In general, it is much easier to getinformation about complementssubstitutes in production from interviewing ISP employees and consulting tradedictionaries, etc. In addition, many ISPs themselves are unsure about complementssubstitutes in demand for theirusers due to the immaturity of the market. Hence, this study tends to emphasize the production side.34 Identifying phrases is easier than it sounds since many ISPs do the same activities and almost always call it thesame thing. Most ISPs listed their nonaccess activities in addition to the access activities, as well as listing theirsupport for many of the same products and protocols. A phrase was typically delimited by a comma or a change inline, which also aided identification. We began with 7,893 phrases and reduced it to 6,795 by eliminating simplecapitalization and punctuation differences.35 Access speeds are standardized for the most part, as are packaged software products. Less standardized are thephrases that accompany the activities of interest, such as educating users, providing advice about network design,and so on.36 This high success rate is somewhat a result of the standardization which thelist imposes on the first part of theirsurvey, which covers some aspects of the online and direct access businesses of ISPs. In classifying the nonaccessparts of the business, the success rate was between 80% and 90% depended on how one counts it. .29access, a presumption that seems consistent with casual perusal of the data.37 MISCBUSINESS takes on one if the ISP maintains another business lines unrelated to computers or communications or TCPIP technologies. Most ofthese were copying, cafes and photography.38 In all cases, the maintained hypothesis is that experience in other linesof business should make a firm more willing to experiment.Other variables try to capture firm investments in durable assets which determine its disposition toexperiment with new lines of business. Each set of estimates tries two different measures of geographic dispersion,which, as earlier noted, is the only available measure of firm size. ONEAREACODE takes on the value one if the ISP maintains service in only one area code, as indicated in thelist. Small geographic size indicates a focus on localcustomers and not a wide regional service territory. This may also indicate lack of access to financial capital toexpand, which should discourage experimentation. MORETHAN20 is a dummy for presence in more than 20 areacodes. This indicates a decision to provide services on a national scale, typically focusing on urban centers. Thismay also signal that the ISP is exposed to considerable national competitive pressures. This is only available fornational firms. ONECOUNTY takes on the value one if the ISP maintains service in only one county, as indicatedin thedirectory. The latter is measured by where the ISP offers local dialup service or maintains a headquarters see Downes and Greenstein 1999 for detail. There was no a priori reason to favor one measure over another. Hence,both were tried.Each specification tries two dummy variables, DIALUP and DEDICATED. DIALUP takes on the valueone when an ISP offers any dialup service, which 98.3% do in some form in the analysis sample. DEDICATEDtakes on one if the ISP offers any direct access, which 90.5% do in some form. The lack of any dialup service is asure sign that an ISP does not intend to offer service to a residential market, focusing exclusively on business users.The lack of any dedicated service indicates that the ISP is not likely to offer any highspeed service, rendering italmost impossible that they also offer frontier access other than cable modems and a few other highspeed wirelessservices. It may also signal the lack of technical expertise within the ISP. Hence, DIALUP should predict lessexperimentation with nonbasic access and DEDICATED should predict more. In practice, every model except thebivariate probit includes both variables. In the bivariate probit, the frontier probit includes only DIALUP and thecomplementary probit includes only DEDICATED. 39Finally, I include a variable labeled HANDHOLDING. This counts the number of useful phrases in thebasic access category. More precisely, an ISPs advertisements may refer to technologies and services that typicallyaccompany the provision of basic access, such as email, shell accounts, domain name registration, search engineregistration, portal links, Real Audio and video, push technology, FTP, Telnet, Gopher, Archie and so on. Virtuallyevery ISP has to support these technologies and services in some form as a requirement for being in the accessbusiness. Explicitly listing them indicates something about an ISPs willingness to make basic access technologyeasy to use for its customers e.g., making them downloadable, offering to help with software installation, etc Since listing these services also involve advertising technology and services which all experienced users alreadyunderstand, this variable may also indicate an effort to market to firsttime users who may not be familiar with themost basic features of Internet access. With either of these two interpretations, HANDHOLDING should positivelypredict the provision of all types of activity except the provision of frontier access. An alternative interpretation isthat HANDHOLDING partially picks up an ISPs disposition to talk about itself in its advertisements, even whenthe subject is something mundane, such as basic access technology. With this last interpretation, HANDHOLDINGshould predict the provision of all activities including frontier access.COMMUNICATIONS, COMPUTER and MISCBUSINESS are defined as stated in the text.EXPERIENCE is a dummy which takes on one if the ISP was listed in thedirectory in the spring of 1997, more thana year earlier than the survey in thelist. Over a years experience in the ISP business could contribute to learning 37 COMMUNICATIONS includes selling cellular telephones, fax machines and long distance voice service.COMPUTERS includes selling PC hardware, software and repair services. Both of these are activities that the firmlikely did prior to entering the access business. Some ISPs also advertise services such as Internet fax, Internettelephony and so on. These latter offerings are not part of this measure because they are not plausibly exogenous.38 Indications about whether the ISP offers consulting services were also collected, though the phrases aboutconsulting were often quite vague and lacked specifics. A dummy for unspecific consulting turned out to be almost aperfect predictor for offering at least one of the networking, hosting and web design businesses. This seemed to bean artifact of the data collection methods and hence, was not useful.39 Not surprisingly, DIALUP is a perfect predictor for experimentation in complementary services and DEDICATED is a perfect predictor for experimentation with high speed access. Hence, only one is included in eachside of the bivariate probit.30about local demand and about how to provide new service offerings. Because ISPs do not list their founding date,this is the only available measure of experience in the access business. In practice, since there has been so muchrecent entry, EXPERIENCE is virtually equivalent to not a very recent entrant.There are five different measures of competitiveness which were tried, only a few of which are shown inthe text. URBAN takes on a value between zero and one, where this number reflects the average number of urbancounties in which the ISP offers local dialup service or maintains a headquarters. A county is urban if it fits underthe broadest definition for urban within the US census. For most ISPs this number is either zero or one. Downes and Greenstein 1999 show that urban areas have attracted many varied types of competitors. Thus, buyers in urbanareas have access to more substitutes and ISPs have more competitors. This competitive environment shouldmotivate any ISP in an urban area to experiment.Second, THREENAT is a dummy that takes on one when there are more than three national firm in thesame county as the ISP. Since national firms are likely to experiment, as noted in table 1, the presence of threevirtually guarantees some competition for a local firm. In practice, since virtually every urban area has manynational ISPs, this variable tends to strongly overlap with URBAN, but covers a slightly smaller set of urbanregions. Because the population thresholds which induce entry of several national ISPs exceeds the populationthresholds which induce several local and regional ISPs to enter, virtually every area with more than three national ISPs already has many local and regional ISPs. In such a setting, virtually all the small ISPs in the analysis samplewill be fringe firms. Third, THREELOCAL is a dummy that take on one when there are more than threelocalregional ISPs in the same county as this ISP. More than three competitors was chosen because three local firmsapproaches a degree of competitiveness where local market power declines. In practice, this variable captures thedifference between counties with the thinnest demand in this data set and those with enough population to support atleast a few ISPs.RBOC and GTE are dummies which take on one if the ISP serves a county in which a regional belloperating company or GTE is the dominant local telephone firm See Greenstein, Lizardo and Spiller 1998 forsources. These companies are both providers of backbone telecommunication services and potential competitors inthe Internet access market. If the RBOC and GTE offer better backbone services than independent telephonecompanies, then this might make it easier for ISPs to experiment, especially with frontier access. More likely, thesecompanies serve as potential competitors for advanced datatransport services, which should motivate ISPs to getinto frontier access as a competitive response. In practice, RBOC tends to strongly overlap with URBAN, while GTE tends to overlap with the areas for which URBAN is zero.URBAN, NATIONAL, THREELOCAL, RBOC, and GTE overlap. There was no a priori reason to favorone measure over another, nor to rule out the possibility of cumulative effects. I favored testing these hypotheses ina flexible way, so all were included. It was found that URBAN was the only factor that ever obtained significance inany specification. Hence, the others were all dropped.Several variables describe the county or counties in which the ISP locates. These variables attempt tocapture population characteristics which influence the demand for Internet services. The specification of thesevariables was inspired by micro studies of household and business demand for computing, PCs and Internetservices.40 However, at best these measures only discuss average features of an area in which an ISP is located.Four fractions between zero and one describe the demographic age of the population. One covers ages 2229, another 3039, another 4064, and another over 65. Two fractions, PCHOME and PCWORK, describe thefraction of households who have adopted a PC at home and who use one regularly at work, as found by PNRassociates in a 1997 survey of over 30,000 households see, e.g., Kridel et al 1997. These tend to be highlycorrelated with FRACPROF, a fraction between zero and one which describes the fraction of the population whichdoes white collar work see Downes and Greenstein 1999. 41 CSITE is the total number of respondents to a surveyof large scale computer use in 1992 divided by population see Greenstein, Lizardo and Spiller 1998, whichindicates the presence of many presumably technically sophisticated local MIS users. The maintained hypothesesis that more PC use at home and work supports a broad demand for many Internet services, both to the home and tobusinesses nearby. In practice, FRACPROF was the only variable that obtained significance in any of thesespecifications. Hence, the others, which were highly correlated with FRACPROF, were dropped.The last variables are UNIVERS1, UNIVERS2 and UNIVERS3, all of which are dummies that measure the 40 For example, Bresnahan and Greenstein 1997 and Clement 1998.41 In practice, FRACPROF correlates highly with education, income and some types of white collar work in aregion, rendering these other demographic measures redundant. I also experimented with several measures of thestrength of the local financial, insurance and real estate markets, but did not find any of them useful.31presence of at least one university in the county in which the ISP provides service.42 These variables test the beliefheld by many within the research community that universities have had a strong positive spillover on thecommercial Internet industry. UNIVERS1 takes on one if there is at least one research university in the countywhich maintains a Ph D and graduate program, according to the Carnegie rankings of universities. UNIVERS2 takeson one if there is at least one university which maintains a graduate but not Ph D programs. UNIVERS3 takes on oneif there is at least one university which maintains an undergraduate program, but no graduate programs.43 Due to thenoncommercial origins of the Internet industry, universities may still act as demanders for Internet services, maystill act as competitors for the delivery of some Internet services, or may still act as supplier of employees and newentrepreneurial talent in the Internet business. Under the maintained hypotheses, these coefficients should bepositive. In practice, all were jointly zero, so all were dropped. 42 Special thanks to Tom Downes for collecting this data and bringing them to my attention.43 I also tested specifications that used the enrollment in engineering and computer science programs in theseuniversities and found no qualitative difference.32Appendix III: Internet Access Industry Product Code Endogenous Variables: Basic Access 110115, High speed access 116 118, Networking 210234, Hosting 310325, Web Development 410422Exogenous Variables: Hand holding 121127, Telecommunications 510, Computers 610632, Misc 810850100 Access set up, service, and maintenance110 Providing and servicing access through different channels Analog access ISDN access Nationwide and worldwide dialup 800 numbers111112113114 Web TV access115 Wireless access116 Generic dedicated Internet access e.g., T1117 Access through cable modems118 Frontier dedicated Internet access e.g., T3, DSL120 Providing basic functionality associated with access121 Email and email functionality122 Necessary complementary technology e.g.,Shell accounts, PPPSLIPCSLIP123 Domain name registration124 125 126 Real Audio and Video127 Old access technology e.g., FTP, Telnet, Gopher, ArchieInternet search engine registration Links to portals and directories includes Newsgroup access130 Advanced functionality associated with access131 Online games132 Chat room133 Video conferencing Screening services134 200 Network, setup, service and maintenance210 Providing and installing network equipment on customer premises211 WAN installation212 Network colocation services213214Network consulting associated with installation LAN installation 220 Maintenance of network facilities on customer premises221 Network maintenance222 Dedicated line maintenance223 Backuprestoration of data 230 Networking and server software Lotus Notes SQL231 232 233 Novell234 Windows NT installation and service300Web site hosting310 Providing basic and generic hosting services312 FTP Server hosting Personalundifferentiated hosting313 314 Ancillary hosting services311Business or Web page hosting 320 Providing tailored hosting services i.e., hosting a customized to specific application321 Advertising hosting322 Hosting a virtual mallvirtual stores 33Building the Virtual World 323 Hosting a bulletin board324 Hosting a special interest information page325 Online catalog400 Web page development and servicing Greenstein410 Providing generic and basic WWW functionality411 Activepages e.g., Shockwave, Active X, Net Show, VR, QTVR, etc.412 Basic design and programming413 Advanced programming, excluding Activepages e.g., CGI scripting, Java, Perl414 415 Editing tools for customers e.g., Microsoft Front PageSecurity and firewall development420 WWW development and service tailored for business and administrative processes 421 Internetcommerce: retailingprocurement422 Business software design500 Telecom services510 Providing traditional communication services 520 Providing traditional communications services521 using TCPIP technology Internet telephony522 Convergent technologies 530 Cable telephony600 Computer hardware and software sales, maintenance and service610 Providing computer equipment 620 Servicing computer equipment 630 Software design and service632 631 Packaged software installation and service Software design and services, n.e.c. includes custom software, programming700 Training800 Services not elsewhere classified 810 Television services811 Cable television812 Satellite television 820 Copy services 821 822 Faxing 830 Multimedia services821 822 823 840 Cafes and meeting places Photocopying Document scanning Converting movies to films Convert catalog to CDROM format841 842 Books Food and beverages 850 Newspapers 34", "filename": "393597911.pdf", "person": ["Shane M Greenstein", "Greenstein, Shane M"], "date": ["2000"]}
