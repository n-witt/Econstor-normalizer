Introduction As scholarly interest in processes of policy diffusion and outcomes of policy reforms grows, the demand for comprehensive datasets on social security systems does as well. In the past, several research projects have compiled comprehensive datasets on social security systems. However, most of these only cover European countries and the OECD world e.g. Comparative Welfare Entitlements Dataset CWED, Comparative Welfare States Dataset CWSD, Social Citizenship Indicator Project SCIP and were often based on data provided by the European Commission or the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD itself. Comprehensive datasets on nonOECD countries are still sparse despite attempts of international organizations such as the World Bank or the International Labour Organization ILO to close this gap. Moreover, many sources e.g. the International Social Security Association ISSA, Social Security Programs throughout the World provided by the United States Social Security Administration USSSA, the Database of National Labour, Social Security and Related Human Rights Legislation NATLEX, the Information System on International Labour Standards NORMLEX or the World Treaty Index only provide qualitative data on social security laws and treaties, which must then be transformed into quantitative data.Subsequently, this working paper provides an encompassing review of social security datasets, which to date have been widely used in comparative welfare state research. In addition to discussing their strengths and shortcomings, I will present data on nonOECD countries that supplement existing projects. Given the fact that only a few comprehensive datasets focus on nonOECD countries e.g. Social Protection Index SPI, SocioEconomic Database for Latin America and the Caribbean SEDLAC, Social Assistance in Developing Countries Database, data from national statistics agencies and social security boards are taken into account as well. Overall, this paper aims to shed light on existing social security data projects and to present data from nonOECD countries that can be used for the analysis of global social security dynamics.In the following, I provide an overview of social security datasets that can be employed for event history analyses. After that, I will focus on data projects of international organizations such as the World Bank, the ILO and the United Nations UN, specifically those that entail data on social security expenditures, social security contributions, social security coverage, duration of benefit receipt, the amount of benefits or qualifying conditions. Furthermore, regional datasets on nonOECD countries, OECD welfare state datasets and data projects with a specific focus on social security are discussed as well. Finally, I will conclude with an overview of social security data from national statistics agencies and social security boards for those countries which are not sufficiently represented in the aforementioned datasets.92. Event Data on Social Security Systems In recent years, welfare state research has been criticized for its nationcentred focus in explaining public policy outcomes. As a result of globalization and the integration of countries within supranational organizations such as the European Union EU, national policies can no longer be analysed in isolation. Moreover, inter and supranational influences as well as relations between nationstates Obinger et al. 2013: 112, emphasis in the original have to be taken into account. In light of a growing interconnectedness of states, current research increasingly focuses on analysing processes of policy diffusion. Thereby, policy diffusion occurs if a governments policy decision systematically depends on policy decisions made in other countries Simmons et al. 2006: 787. In order to analyse the diffusion of social security systems in global perspective, event datasets that code the implementation of social security laws and treaties are required. With regard to this goal, five data projects entail valuable information for the construction of event datasets: 1 the International Social Security Association ISSA; 2 Social Security Programs Throughout the World provided by USSSA; 3 the Database of National Labour, Social Security and Related Human Rights Legislation NATLEX, ILO; 4 the Information System on International Labour Standards NORMLEX, ILO; and 5 the World Treaty Index. In the following, I will discuss the strengths and shortcomings of the mentioned datasets and visualize their commonalities and differences in coding social security legislation.2.1 INt ERNAt IONAL SOCIAL SECu RIty ASSOCIAt ION AND SOCIAL SECu RIty PROGRAm S th ROu Gh Out th E WORLD The International Social Security Association ISSA provides data on social security legislation in 176 countries and distinguishes between five domains of social security: 1 Family benefits; 2 old age, disability and survivors; 3 sickness and maternity; 4 unemployment; and 5 work injury. This information is available on the ISSA website but has to be transformed into quantitative data. Beyond the domains of social security, ISSA distinguishes between different social security systems which are subdivided into the following ten categories: 1 Social insurance; 2 social assistance; 3 employmentrelated; 4 universal; 5 meanstested; 6 individual account; 7 mandatory occupational pension; 8 mandatory private insurance; 9 provident funds; and 10 employerliability system. Under each category, coverage lists persons eligible for receiving the given cash or in kind benefits. Furthermore, the ISSA provides information on the payments of contributions and distinguishes between four kinds of contributors: 1 Insured person; 2 selfemployed person; 3 em10WORKING PAPERS 03 2014ployer; and 4 government. The ISSA also refers to the qualifying conditions that have to be met in order to be eligible for social security benefits. For example, this may comprise a percentage constraint in workforce to qualify for occupational invalidity benefits or a minimum period of contributions to be eligible for unemployment benefit. Lastly, the amount of benefits that can be received from each of the social security programmes is added according to national currency.One problematic issue with the information provided by the ISSA is the presentation of the data. For each of the mentioned domains of social security, the ISSA lists the law which has been passed first first law and the laws which are currently in force current laws. However, the presentation of the data alongside the mentioned scheme makes it impossible to identify which part of a regulation still refers to the first law and which parts have been reformed. Due to this shortcoming, change over time and breaks cannot be documented. Nevertheless, it is possible to simply code the passage of laws on a given issue without focusing on its exact content.The Social Security Programs Throughout the World project provided by the United States Social Security Administration USSSA entails the same data as ISSA but slightly differs with regard to the data presentation. On the one hand, the USSSA mainly refers to the core laws that have been passed on social security, only partially mentioning amendments. In addition, the exact description of the laws and their identification number are not listed but short keywords on the content of a law are provided. In contrast to the ISSA, the USSSA updates its data every two years but still provides the older versions on the website see for example the data on Europe: 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012. Therefore, it is possible to document change over time for at least eight to ten years. In sum, the data presented by the ISSA and the USSSA are especially useful for coding the passage of social security laws, their topical context as well as the kind of social security system to which they belong to without taking a too narrow focus on specific differences of the social security systems or on change over time with regard to the content of social security laws.2.2 DAt ABASE OF NAt IONAL LABOu R, SOCIAL SECu RIty AND RELAt ED hum AN RIGht S LEGISLAt ION AND INFORm At ION Sy St Em ON INt ERNAt IONAL LABOu R St ANDARDSThe Database of National Labour, Social Security and Related Human Rights Legislation NATLEX mainly provides data on social security legislation at the national level and distinguishes between the following categories of social security: 1 Social security general standards; 2 medical care and sickness benefit; 3 oldage, invalidity and survivors benefit; 4 employment accident and occupational disease benefit; 5 unemployment benefit; 6 social assistance and services; 7 administration and financing; and 8 maternity protection this category does 11not belong to social security but serves as a category on its own. In addition to this, specific laws for seafarers are listed in the category Seafarers Social Security, whereas international agreements are subsumed under the category international social security agreements. With regard to the kind of laws, NATLEX distinguishes between 1 constitution; 2 law, act; 3 regulation, decree, ordinance; 4 miscellaneous circular, directive, legal notice, instruction, etc.; 5 international agreement; 6 EU directive; 7 EU regulation; 8 EU decision, 9 EU recommendation; 10 collective agreement; and 11 case law. Furthermore, NATLEX provides information on the scope of social security laws and refers to the following five categories: 1 European Union; 2 international; 3 national; 4 nonmetropolitan territories; and 5 state or province. On the website, countries and categories can be selected for which laws are displayed with information on their date of passage as well as on their date of implementation. The names of the laws are listed in the national language, often with a keyword or a short summary in English. Moreover, the original legal text is also available as a pdfsheet. For every law, which has been passed, additional links to amendments and repeals are listed within a grey box from which the following forms can be distinguished: 1 Repealed texts; 2 amending texts; 3 related texts; 4 implementing texts; and 5 basic texts. The last category refers to the original law that has been passed in relation to a given domain of social security. Due to the fact that NATLEX provides a lot of information, a very precise dataset on social security legislation could be established. However, it is also difficult to handle with the preciseness of NATLEX as for every law there exist further amendments and subcategories of the amendments so that coding all these laws would be very finegrained.In comparison to NATLEX, the Information System on International Labour Standards NORMLEX mainly refers to the content of international agreements of the ILO and distinguishes between the following kinds of agreements: 1 Conventions; 2 protocols; and 3 recommendations. Especially interesting are conventions on which protocols and recommendations are based.The category status on the website lists whether conventions are still in force. For repealed conventions, NORMLEX sometimes provides links to their revisions from which one can derive information on the exact date of repeal. Another way to retrieve information on repeals is selecting the category conventions and recommendations by subject and status, which entails specific information on the status of a convention and is displayed in the following manner: 1 Uptodate instrument; 2 instrument with interim status; 3 withdrawn instrument; 4 instrument to be revised; 5 outdated instrument; and 6 shelved convention. Furthermore, the category uptodate conventions comprises all conventions that are currently in force. Concerning the topical domains, NORMLEX distinguishes, inter alia, between: 1 Social security; 2 maternity protection; and 3 seafarers. The third category exclusively refers to jobrelated regulations for seafarers 12WORKING PAPERS 03 2014ty belongs to the category 2SECUR. Nevertheless, the titles of the laws are listed in a way that the treaties can be allocated to one of the issues. Beyond the category on social security, there also exists the category 2LABOR, which among other things focuses on maternity leave and on workers health of safety. The advantage of the World Treaty Index is that it is a good display of bilateral and multilateral treaties, which can be used to accomplish the data on national social security legislation with an international perspective. The differences and commonalities between all datasets are listed in Table 1. that are in general concerned with social security as well as with pensions and health insurance. To conclude, the dataset is especially useful for analysing temporal variance with regard to the introduction of conventions. 2.3 WORLD t REAty INDEx The World Treaty Index project focuses on international agreements on social security as well as on the contracting parties and distinguishes between 28 forms of international agreements. Whereas information on bilateral treaties can be found on the website, information on multilateral treaties is presented within an Excelsheet that is available in two forms. The first sheet entails data wherein every treaty is listed once with the respective treaty parties. The second sheet lists every treaty with the treaty partners displayed in dyadic form. In addition, more specific information is provided on 1 the treaty number; 2 the edition of the volume in which the treaty has been published; 3 the page number on which the treaty can be found; 4 the date when the treaty came into force; 5 the place or organization where the treaty has been ratified; as well as 6 the place where the treaty has been registered. Treaties on social security are listed within the category 2SECUR, which covers the following issues: 1 Social security entails all treaties, which are generally concerned with social security; 2 retirements; 3 old age benefits; 4 disability; and 5 unemployment compensation. The dataset does not distinguish between these forms but only reports that the trea13Table 1: Visualization of event data Dataset International Social Security Association ISSA and Social Security Programs Throughout the World USSSA NATLEX ILO Countries 176 ISSA, 176 USSSA 196 Domain of social security 1.

Global Data on Social Security In comparison to the aforementioned eventbased data sources, there exist far more datasets on social security revenues and expenditures as well as on the design of social security systems. These comprise information on the coverage of social security systems, benefit generosity and the duration or the waiting period for receiving benefits. In the following, I will first discuss datasets with a global focus, as provided by international organizations such as the World Bank, the ILO and the UN. Then, I will refer to datasets with a regional focus on nonOECD countries, before turning to common welfare state datasets and projects on specific issues of social security for the OECD world and the European Union.3.1 WORLD BANk The World Bank offers four datasets that cover social security: 1 The Atlas of Social Protection Indicators of Resilience and Equity ASPIRE, 20052010; 2 World Development Indicators WDI, 19602013; 3 Global Financial Development 19602011; and 4 Spending on Social Safety Nets 19962006.The first project, ASPIRE, focuses on 59 countries, which mainly do not belong to the OECD or the EU. With regard to social security, they address four domains: 1 Social insurance; 2 labour market; 3 social assistance; and 4 remittances. These are further subdivided into smaller categories. Thereby, the category social insurance comprises 1 old age contributory pensions including old age, survivors, disability; and 2 social securityhealth insurance including occupational injury benefits, paid sick leave, health insurance, maternity and other forms of social insurance. The second category focuses on labour market programmes and includes the following issues: 1 Unemployment compensation; 2 severance pay; 3 early retirement due to labour market reasons; 4 labour market services intermediation; 5 training vocational, life, skills, cash for training; 6 job rotation and job sharing; 7 employment incentiveswages subsidies; 8 supported employment and rehabilitation; as well as 9 employment measures for the disabled. The category social assistance comprises 1 cash transferslast resort programmes; 2 social pension; 3 other cash transfers programmes; 4 conditional cash transfers; 5 in kind food transfers; 6 school feeding; 7 other social assistance programmes; and 8 public works. Last but not least, the category remittances distinguishes between 1 domestic remittances; 2 remittances from abroad; 3 income and support from charity; and 4 other private transfers. These categories are displayed by one of the following indicators: 1 Average per capita transfer; 2 coverage; 3 benefit incidence; 4 beneficiary incidence; 5 generosity; 6 gini inequality reduction; 7 poverty headcount reduction; 8 poverty gap reduction; 9 cost benefit ratio; or 10 social protection overlap. Due to 16WORKING PAPERS 03 2014its display with ten indicators, this dataset has a high compatibility and therefore is a valuable source for extending existing data projects. However, the covered period is too short for analysing major changes in social security systems.Secondly, the World Development Indicators WDI project covers roughly 200 countries and focuses on benefits, the generosity of social security systems, programme participation as well as social exclusion equity and social protection ratings ranging from low 1 to high 6. With regard to benefits, WDI reports the benefits received by the first twenty per cent of the population concerning all social insurance, all social protection, all safety nets or unemployment benefits and active labour market policies. The level of generosity and programme participation are additionally listed for all domains of social security given.In contrast, the Global Financial Development dataset only provides information on pension fund assets in relation to the Gross Domestic Product GDP for 197 countries, territories and islands.Lastly, the Spending on Social Safety Nets dataset has compiled social expenditure data measured as a percentage of GDP, including items such as: 1 Social insurance; 2 social assistance; 3 total social protection; 4 education; 5 health; 6 total social spending; and 7 total government spending. Furthermore, the dataset provides useful qualitative information on the design of social security systems such as on coverage, benefits or contributions. The problem of the expenditure data is that for each country the data is only available for one point in time during the period from 1996 to 2006. Hence, few countries refer to the same year and thus reduces the comparability of the dataset.In sum, the World Bank offers some interesting data projects, which cover a broad range of countries. However, one shortcoming is that ASPIRE and Spending on Social Safety Nets focus on a too short time span. 3.2 INt ERNAt IONAL LABOu R ORGANIz At IONThe ILO provides five datasets which focus on social security: 1 Cost of Social Security 19901996; 2 Cost of Social Security in collaboration with the Mannheim Centre for European Social Research MZES 19491993; 3 Social Security Inquiry SECSOC, 20002009; 4 Social Security Database 19892012; and 5 Conditions of Work and Employment Programme TRAVAIL, 19452013.The Cost of Social Security dataset focuses on social protection expenditure and social protection receipts, which can be displayed in national currency and as a percentage of GDP. With regard to the expenditures on social protection benefits, the dataset distinguishes between cash and in kind benefits for the following domains: 1 Old age; 2 survivors; 3 invalidity; 4 employment injury; 5 sickness and health; 6 family benefits; 7 unemployment; 8 housing; 9 social assistance and others; 10 administrative costs; 11 other expenditure; and 12 transfers to reserves. Concerning social security receipts, however, the dataset re17fers to a different category scheme. The six categories comprise 1 oldage, invalidity and survivors programme; 2 employment injury programme; 3 sickness and health programme; 4 unemployment programme; 5 family programme; and 6 housing and social assistance programme. For each domain, information on protected persons and employers contributions are available as well as on taxes and transfers from reserves. The advantage of this project is that it covers 112 countries. However, the data is presented separately for each country, which must first be merged for comparative quantitative analyses. The disadvantage of this project is that the data presentation on expenditures and receipts varies over time and with regard to the given country so that it is not always comparable. This is especially true for the years before 1994, which have a completely different coding scheme.In collaboration with the ILO, the MZES extended the Cost of Social Security data under the direction of Peter Flora and Franz Kraus. Their project covers 23 European countries over the period from 1949 to 1993. While providing the original data for each of the countries separately, they also proposed a coding scheme for merging the data and to counter the problem of comparability of the different sources. Their coding scheme comprises the following variables: 1 Agency referring to the kind of social security system; 2 body referring to the institution responsible for social security; 3 eligibility criterion for coverage; 4 scope; 5 contingency; 6 riskneed; 7 contractual basis of the establishment of the scheme; 8 form of establishment of entitlement; 9 mode of apportionment of financing; 10 type of receipts; and 11 type of intervention. To conclude, this dataset is a valuable source for gaining an indepth understanding of social security systems and their financing in European countries.Another data project of the ILO is the Social Security Inquiry SECSOC. This dataset covers a variety of social security issues such as short and longterm benefits, the requirements for receiving meanstested benefits, guaranteed minimum benefits, social security coverage and their duration as well as social security expenditure and benefit receipt ratios. The advantage of this dataset is that it comprises 97 countries and so also entails nonEuropean and nonOECD countries. Furthermore, it refers to the social risks and needs of 1 old age; 2 disability; 3 survivorship; 4 sickness; 5 maternity; and 6 unemployment. However, only the period from 2000 to 2012 is covered.The Social Security Database includes 125 countries and is subdivided into two parts: 1 Social Security Database Programmes and Mechanisms; and 2 Social Security Expenditure Database. The first dataset provides qualitative information on the social security systems in the given countries including: 1 Sickness; 2 maternity; 3 old age; 4 invalidity also called disability; 5 sickness also called death; 6 family allowances; 7 work injury; and 8 unemployment. Furthermore, the first dataset also offers data on the financing, the conditionality as well as the coverage of social security. Even though this part comprises valuable information on the design of social security systems, 18WORKING PAPERS 03 2014the majority of its information is based on data provided by the USSSA. In contrast, the Social Security Expenditure Database focuses on all kinds of expenditure associated with 1 health care; 2 sickness; 3 maternity; 4 old age; 5 invalidity; 6 survivors; 7 family allowances; 8 work injury; and 9 unemployment. This comprises public, mandatory as well as private expenditure and is available for the period from 1989 to 2005.The last project, Conditions of Work and Employment Program TRAVAIL, offers qualitative information on regulations for 1 working time; 2 minimum wages; and 3 maternity protection. With regard to social security, the last category is of particular interest. It focuses on the following issues: 1 Scope; 2 qualifying conditions; 3 duration; 4 and the leave due to illness or complications during pregnancy. Furthermore, the regulations on parental leave, paternity leave and adoption leave are listed as well as information on the amount of cash benefits and their duration. In addition, the TRAVAIL project covers topics such as medical benefits, health protection and nondiscrimination as well as employment security for the parents. One of the interesting aspects of this project is the interactive data selection on its website. Here, users can select the relevant categories and countries so that information on the regulations is displayed.Beyond qualitative information on the content of maternity protection regulations, the data project also entails historical information on the general duration of maternity leave and the amount of benefits. The data is available for the years 1994, 1998, 2004 and 2009. Additionally, one can derive information on the financing institutions of maternity leave for the years covered. The dataset is regularly updated and therefore displays current regulations on maternity protection. As the information on which paragraph a regulation refers to is listed as well, it is further possible to identify when a regulation was introduced and to code events on social security legislation, accordingly.3.3 u NIt ED NAt IONSThe United Nations offer data on social security within its regional departments such as the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean ECLAC, the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia ESCWA, the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific Region ESCAP and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe UNECE. The Comision Economica para America Latina y el Caribe Statistics CEPALSTAT of ECLAC covers 15 Latin American and Caribbean countries over the period from 1989 to 2005 and entails data on 1 wage earners who contribute to social security; 2 employees covered by social security; 3 employed persons, who contribute to social security; as well as 4 health and social public expenditure.Similarly, ESCWA focuses on Middle Eastern countries, comprising Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the Sudan, Syria and the United Arab Emirates. In comparison to ECLAC, information on health expenditure and on prenatal care coverage can 19only be derived for different points in time 1999, 2000, 2005 and 2010. to 2050, the remaining data is only available for the period from 1990 to 2012.The ESCAP project comprises 53 countries in the Asian and the Pacific region offering data on the oldage support ratio, various forms of health expenditure e.g. private or outof pocket expenditure, the number of physicians and hospital beds as well as data on prenatal care coverage. Although the oldage support ratio is estimated for the period from 1980 Lastly, the UNECE department provides data on the prenatal care coverage for sixty European countries during the period from 1988 to 2012.To conclude, the departments of the United Nations entail virtually every country but cover only few social security issues and short time spans.4. Regional Data NonOECD Countriesgrammes. Even though these indices are useful for comparing the extent of social protection among Asian and Pacific countries, they are not suitable to compare countries on a global scale. Furthermore, the Social Protection Index project comprises information on the number of beneficiaries covered by the social security system and on social security expenditure. Beyond the Social Protection Index project, the ADB statistical database system also entails data on social security and welfare expenditure for 48 countries during the period from 1988 to 2012.In this section, regional datasets on nonOECD countries are reviewed, which serve as a valuable supplement to the aforementioned data projects. The most comprehensive datasets are available for Latin America and the Caribbean as well as for the Asian and Pacific region. Thus, information is particularly lacking for the African continent.4.1 ASIAN DEv ELOPm ENt BANk The Asian Development Bank ADB provides data for 42 countries in the Asian and the Pacific region. Its Social Protection Index SPI project offers an index that comparatively measures the scope and depth of different social security programmes, including social insurance, social assistance and active labour market policies. In addition, an overall indicator is calculated for all social security pro20WORKING PAPERS 03 20144.2 ASEAN SOCIAL SECu RIty ASSOCIAt ION The ASEAN Social Security Association ASSA offers country specific information on the social security systems of nine of its ten member states: Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Comprehensive reports for each country can be obtained, which are regularly updated, covering years from 2005 to 2013. Moreover, the ASSA has published three books entitled Social Security Profiles, two of which are available on their website. The first edition mainly includes quantitative data for the years 1995 to 1997 for the following issues: 1 Rates of contributions as percentage of wages; 2 contributions in millions of Rupiah; 3 social security membership; 4 benefits; and 5 other financial statistics. These categories focus on different domains of social security such as pension schemes. However, only five countries are covered in this edition, namely Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines. The third edition revises the previous two editions so that it provides a wellstructured overview of social security legislation, related schemes as well as the extent of coverage. In comparison to the first edition, Brunei Darussalam and Vietnam are also included. Thus, the ASSA is a valuable source for obtaining indepth information on the structure and organization of social security systems as well as on their legislative context.4.3 SOCIOECONOm IC DAt ABASE FOR LAt IN Am ERICA AND th E CARIBBEANThe Centre for Distributional, Labour and Social Studies CEDLAS of the National University de la Plata offers the SocioEconomic Database for Latin America and the Caribbean SEDLAC in collaboration with the World Bank. The project covers 16 Latin American and Caribbean countries especially during the period from 1990 to 2011 and includes data on the share of salaried workers with the right to pensions or health insurance for different age groups and education levels. Even though the dataset provides useful information, the split into different age groups and education levels reduces the comparability with other datasets. The covered time spans vary depending on the country context.4.4 SOCIAL POLICy IN LAt IN Am ERICA AND th E CARIBBEAN DAt ASEt The Social Policy in Latin America and the Caribbean Dataset compiled by Evelyne Huber, John D. Stephens, Thomas Mustillo and Jennifer Pribble at the University of North Carolina, focuses on 26 Latin American and Caribbean countries between 1960 to 2006. The dataset solely comprises expenditure data with regard to 1 social expenditure; 2 social security expenditure; and 3 social security and welfare expenditure. The data is available as a percentage of overall expenditure or in relation to GDP.214.5 CARIBBEAN COmmu NIty 4.7 SOCIAL ASSISt ANCE IN DEv ELOPING COu Nt RIES DAt ABASEThe Social Assistance in Developing Countries Database compiled by Armando Barrientos, Miguel NinoZarazua and Mathilde Maitrot from the Chronic Poverty Research Centre and the Brooks World Poverty Institute at the University of Manchester provides qualitative information on social assistance programmes in 52 developing countries in Latin America, Africa and the Asian and Pacific region. The dataset covers social assistance programmes since 1945 but mainly refers to programmes adopted during the past twenty years. The information primarily covers programme objectives, transfers, the targeted population and coverage, the selection criteria of beneficiaries, costs, programme start date as well as additional issues related to implementing social assistance programmes. Moreover, the database distinguishes between the following three forms of social assistance programmes: 1 Pure income transfers; 2 transfers plus interventions with the focus on human, financial or physical asset accumulation; and 3 integrated poverty reduction programmes.SECREt ARIAt The Caribbean Community Secretariat CARICOM provides qualitative data on contribution periods and qualifying conditions for 17 Caribbean islands, specifically focusing on the following social risks: 1 Invalidity; 2 industrial disablementoccupational disease; 3 old ageretirement; 4 survivors; and 5 industrial death. The main shortcoming is that the data on e.g. contribution periods or qualifying conditions is not provided with reference to a particular law or point in time. Additionally, the qualitative information has to be transformed for quantitative data analyses. However, the CARICOM is a valuable source for capturing different patterns of social security welfare in the Caribbean region.4.6 FEDERAt ION OF PENSION Fu NDS ADm INISt RAt ORS The Federation of Pension Funds Administrators FIAP collects information associated with different kinds of pensions and provides data on 1 affiliates to pension funds; 2 total number of pensions; 3 pension contributions; 4 number of contributors; or 5 insurance premiums. With regard to the regional focus, the dataset refers to Latin America, Asia and Europe and covers 15 countries between 1981 to 2006 or again from 1999 to 2005.22WORKING PAPERS 03 20145. OECD Welfare State Datasets In the following, I will discuss five of the best known and most comprehensive welfare state datasets for the European and OECD context: 1 Comparative Welfare States Dataset CWSD; 2 Comparative Welfare Reform Dataset Version II CWRDii; 3 Comparative Welfare Entitlements Dataset CWED; 4 Social Citizenship Indicator Project SCIP; and 5 Quality of Government Qo G Social Policy Dataset. After, I present additional data projects with a more narrow focus on specific social security issues and refer to the data provided by the European Commission, the OECD and the European Data Centre for Work and Welfare EDAC.5.1 COm PARAt Iv E WELFARE St At ES DAt ASEt The Comparative Welfare States Dataset CWSD established by David Brady Berlin Social Science Center, WZB, Evelyne Huber and John D. Stephens both from the University of North Carolina comprises 22 Western European countries and entails variables for the years 1960 to 2011. The dataset covers issues such as benefit generosity, social security benefit expenditure as well as in and outpatient medical coverage through public programmes and medical care.5.2 COm PARAt Iv E WELFARE REFORm DAt ASEt In comparison to the Comparative Welfare State Dataset, the Comparative Welfare Reform Dataset Version 2 CWRDii of Stefan Kuhner from the University of York ranges from 1960 to 2010 and focuses on 23 OECD countries. Data covers year to year changes in social expenditure, public net social expenditure, social security benefit expenditure, social security generosity indices, net replacement rates for the short and longterm unemployed, strictness of employment protection as well as data on the waiting days and duration of benefits.5.3 COm PARAt Iv E WELFARE ENt It LEm ENt S DAt ASEt Following these examples, Lyle Scruggs, Kati Kuitto and Detlef Jahn, however, extend both datasets to focus more entirely on the design of social security systems. Their Comparative Welfare Entitlements Dataset CWED covers the period from 1970 to 2011 and comprises 32 OECD countries and Taiwan. The dataset centres on 1 unemployment; 2 sickness; and 3 pensions. Whereas data on single and family replacement rates is provided as well as on the duration, waiting days and coverage of benefits for the first two categories, the category of pensions solely refers to single and family replacement rates as well as to coverage. Ad23ditionally, it entails information on minimum and standard replacement rates, the ratio of employee pension contributions to employer and employee pension contributions, years of earnings used in the pensionable wage calculation, male and female retirement age and the life expectancy at age 65.5.4 SOCIAL CIt Iz ENSh IP INDICAt OR PROj ECt The Social Citizenship Indicator Project SCIP provided by the Swedish Institute for Social Research SOFI at University of Stockholm entails similar data than the Comparative Welfare Entitlements Dataset CWED. It focuses on 1 pensions; 2 unemployment; 3 sickness; and 4 accidents and offers data on minimum, maximum and standard benefits as well as on replacement rates, social security coverage, waiting days and takeup ratios. The data is available every three or five years since 1930, covering the longest period of all welfare state datasets. However, it only comprises 18 OECD member states.5.5 Qu ALIty OF GOv ERNm ENt SOCIAL POLICy DAt ASEt The Quality of Government Qo G Social Policy Dataset is a synthesis of the aforementioned datasets and additional data from related projects, such as the Iversen and Cusack data on the consequences and causes of welfare state expansion IversenCusack 2000 a, b, c. Some of the data is available in timeseries format between 1946 to 2009, whereas other variables are only available as crosssectional data, mainly for the year 2002. The advantage of the Qo G Social Policy Dataset is that it covers a broad range of variables and entails data from all major welfare state datasets. Moreover, its crosssectional data refers to 194 countries and is therefore not limited to the OECD world. Its main disadvantage, however, is that the many gaps in the data over time renders it unsuitable for multivariate regressions with a focus on longer time spans. Furthermore, recent years are not sufficiently covered.6. Further Datasets Europe and the OECD World The following datasets also focus on the European Union or the OECD world but refer to specific domains of social security, including: 1 General Government and Taxation Data; 2 Comparative Family Database; 3 Comparative Political Dataset I and III; 4 Social Assistance and Minimum Income Protection Interim Dataset Sa Mip; and 5 Unemployment Replacement Rates Database. To conclude my 24WORKING PAPERS 03 2014data review on social security in Europe and the OECD world, I will additionally present those organisations and projects from which many of the aforementioned datasets derive their information. This comprises 1 the European Commission; 2 the OECD; and 3 the European Data Centre for Work and Welfare EDAC.6.1 GENERAL GOv ERNm ENt AND t Ax At ION DAt AThe General Government and Taxation Data, which was established by Thomas R. Cusack at the Berlin Social Science Center WZB, refers to twenty OECD countries and comprises the years from 1950 to 1995. With regard to social security, data on social security contributions as a percentage share of GDP can be obtained.6.2 COm PARAt Iv E FAm ILy POLICy DAt ABASEThe Comparative Family Policy Database compiled by Anna Gauthier from the Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demographic Institute NIDI in The Hague focuses on those parts of social security concerned with families. Her project consists of the following two datasets: 1 Comparative Family Cash Database; and 2 Comparative Maternity, Parental, and Childcare Leave and Benefits Database. The first one provides data on 1 family allowances expenditure; 2 monthly family allowances for the first, second or third child; as well as 3 an index of disposable income; and 4 the value of tax and benefit transfers to a twochild family. The data is available for the period from 1960 to 2008, for which 22 OECD countries are covered. The Comparative Maternity, Parental, and Childcare Leave and Benefits Database in turn focuses on information such as 1 the total number of weeks of maternity or parental leave; 2 the number of weeks of maternity leave prior and after childbirth; and 3 the cash benefits paid during parental leave or childcare leave. Additionally, this dataset includes qualitative information for when the first regulation on maternity protection was introduced, making it further suitable for event history analyses. In contrast to the Comparative Family Cash Database, this dataset covers two more years, ranging from 1960 to 2010.6.3 COm PARAt Iv E POLIt ICAL DAt ASEt S I AND IIIThe Comparative Political Datasets I and III provided by the University of Bern under the direction of Klaus Armingeon mainly focus on features of the political system, but also offer data on social security. The Comparative Political Dataset I covers the period from 1960 to 2011 and refers to 23 OECD countries, whereas the Comparative Political Dataset III only ranges from 1990 to 2011 but comprises 35 OECD countries.Furthermore, the Comparative Political Datasets I includes data on 1 social security transfers; 2 public and mandatory private social expenditure in cash or in kind as percentage of GDP for various forms of social security e.g. old age, survivors, incapacity health, family, active labour market programmes etc.; and 3 25unemployment compensation. In contrast, the Comparative Political Dataset III provides data on 1 social security receipts; 2 tax revenue of social security funds; as well as on 3 Social benefits and therefore can be used for a completion of the Comparative Political Dataset I. available in various forms as net, gross and average replacement rates. In addition, data is provided on 1 taxes; 2 the benefit rate for single persons with no children; 3 social security contributions; and 4 allowances for one earner families with two children.6.6 Eu ROPEAN COmm ISSIONThe European Commission offers data on social protection within the European System of Integrated Social Protection Statistics ESSPROS as well as within the Mutual Information System on Social Protection MISSOC. The ESSPROS project entailed in Eurostat, is mainly concerned with 1 social protection expenditure in general and in particular with the social risks of 2 sickness; 3 invalidity; 4 old age; 5 survivors; 6 familychildren; 7 unemployment; 8 housing; and 9 social exclusion. The data can either be displayed as percentage of GDP or Euro in millions and mainly covers the period from 1999 to 2010.In addition, MISSOC provides more specific data on the design of social security systems. Included are information on the 1 financing of social security systems; 2 in kind sickness benefits; 3 cash sickness benefits; 4 maternity and paternity; 5 invalidity; 6 age; 7 survivors; 8 work injury and occupational disease; 9 family allowances; 10 unemployment; 11 minimum collateral; and 12 longterm care. The data appears twice a year since 2006 and once in the first two years i.e. 2004 and 2005.6.4 SOCIAL ASSISt ANCE AND m INImum INCOm E PROt ECt ION INt ERIm DAt ASEt The Social Assistance and Minimum Income Protection Interim DataSet Sa Mip provided by the Swedish Institute for Social Research SOFI at the University of Stockholm refers to 34 OECD countries and covers the years from 1990 to 2009. It comprises data on meanstested social benefits for the following issues: 1 Social assistance; 2 childrens allowances; 3 household surcharges; 4 singleparents benefits; and 5 family aid.6.5 u NEm PLOym ENt REPLACEm ENt RAt ES DAt ASEt The Unemployment Replacement Rates Dataset established by Olaf van Vliet and Koen Caminada at the University of Leiden focuses on 34 OECD countries during the period from 1971 to 2009. The dataset is an update of the Comparative Welfare State Entitlements Dataset CWED and comprises extended and modified data. Unemployment replacement rates are 26WORKING PAPERS 03 20146.8 Eu ROPEAN DAt A CENt RE OF WORk AND WELFAREThe EDAC which is part of the Reconciling Work and Welfare RECWOWE project comprises more than 500 datasets associated with work, care and welfare. EDAC offers many of the previously mentioned datasets like the Comparative Family Policy Database, the Comparative Welfare Reform Dataset, the Comparative Welfare States Data Set or the Social Citizenship Indicator Project. Moreover, various EU reports are listed with data on social security expenditure and social security contributions as well as additional OECD data projects on social indicators, pension systems or benefits and wages. EDAC also comprises links to national statistics agencies and to global statistical data banks and so is one of the most comprehensive databases for searching social security data, especially for European and OECD countries.6.7 OECDSimilarly to the European Commission, the OECD offers various data on social security. First, the OECD.Stat Extracts website entails the Social Expenditure Database SOCX, providing data related to social security expenditure, including: 1 Old age; 2 survivors; 3 incapacity related; 4 health; 5 family; 6 active labour market programmes; 7 unemployment; 8 housing; and 9 other social policy areas. The expenditure data is further subdivided into cash benefits and in kind benefits. Moreover, it can be distinguished between different forms of social security expenditure: 1 Public; 2 mandatory private; 3 public and mandatory private; 4 voluntary private; 5 net public; and 6 net private. For each kind of social security expenditure, further information can be derived. For example, old age expenditure is subdivided into pension, early retirement pension and other types of old age expenditure. Beyond data on social security expenditure, the OECD also provides data on 1 pension replacement rates gross and net; 2 pension wealth gross and net; as well as on 3 taxes and benefits for different family and labour market constellations. The data is available for all OECD member states mainly during the period from 1980 to 2013 and thus can be used for multivariate regression analyses. Moreover, the annual OECD Factbooks are further sources for obtaining social security data.277. National Statistics Agencies and Social Security Boards As many of the existing datasets provide limited coverage of nonOECD countries and also some European and OECD countries, it is further necessary to account for data of national statistics agencies and social security boards. Such information can add important data to existing projects. In the following, I will list countries with poor coverage in the aforementioned datasets and the main indicators available on social security. Most extensive data, however, is only available for recent years. With regard to Africa, many statistics agencies use the same standardized websites and therefore encompass the same data, which are mainly concerned with issues such as malnutrition, access to water and HIV prevalence. Information on the design of social security systems is only available for a few countries. Compared to Africa, Latin America, the former communist countries of the Eastern Bloc as well as many Asian countries and Pacific islands are more comprehensive.28WORKING PAPERS 03 2014Table 2: Social

Today, public communication is substantially determined by the media. This is also the case for the field of global social policy. The following study addresses the question of how global social policy and, in particular, the International Labour Organization ILO as the key player in global social policy, is discussed in the media. Are global social policy and the ILO visible at all in the media? To what extent is the organisation visible? How do the media report about the ILO and on what exactly does media coverage of the ILO focus?54WORKING PAPERS 03 2014Herbert Obinger Klaus Petersen Mass Warfarethe Welfare State and Causal Mechanismsand Effects Ze SWorking Paper No. 022014Herbert ObingerKlaus Petersen Mass Warfare and the Welfare State Causal Mechanisms and Effects Ze SArbeitspapier 022014The question whether and how warfare has influenced the development of advanced Western welfare states is contested. So far, scholarly work either focused on the tradeoff between military and social spending or on case studies of individual countries. What is missing, however, is a systematic comparative approach that is informed by an explicit consideration of the underlying causal mechanisms. This paper outlines an agenda for a comparative analysis of the warfare welfare state nexus. By distinguishing between three different phases war preparation, warfare, and postwar period it provides a comprehensive analysis of possible causal mechanisms linking war and the welfare state and provides preliminary empirical evidence for war waging, occupied and neutral countries in the age of mass warfare stretching from ca. the 1860s to the 1960s.WORKING PAPERS 03 2014", "filename": "795349955.pdf", "person": ["Aline Gr\u00fcnewald", "Gr\u00fcnewald, Aline"], "date": ["2014"]}
