IZA Discussion Paper No. 815 July 2003 ABSTRACT Measuring Heterogeneity in the Returns to Education in Norway Using Educational Reforms The decision to take more education is complex, and is influenced by individual ability, financial constraints, family background, preferences, etc. Such factors, normally unobserved by the researcher, introduce endogeneity and heterogeneity problems into estimating the returns to education. In this paper, these problems are addressed by estimating a comparative advantage model for schooling, in which the returns to education vary at different levels of education. The model requires that instruments must be specified at each level of education, and we suggest that different school reforms in Norway can serve as suitable instruments. In particular, we exploit the staged implementation of a major reform in the comprehensive school system in the 1960s. We find that the returns to education are strongly nonlinear. In particular, we find that the returns to upper secondary school and shorter programs at regional colleges, together with masters programs at universities, have high returns as measured by wages. Also, we find that the average treatment effect is surprisingly high for mediumlength educations up to two years of college education. This means that increasing the general level of education, which was the intention of the comprehensive school reform of the 1960s and of other school reforms, has the potential to generate a high return in wages, although we do not consider the cost to society. We also find that there is a substantial difference between the average treatment effect and the effect of treatment on the treated for bachelors and masters degrees at universities.

Factors such as individual ability, financialconstraints, family background and preferences are usually unobserved by theresearcher. This creates an endogeneity problem inherent in most evaluation andlabor market studies; see Griliches 1976, Heckman 1974, 1976 and Gronau1974. An additional problem relates to observed and unobserved heterogeneityin the return parameters of education and the interpretation of different returnparameters; see Lang 1991, Willis and Rosen 1979, Card 1995, 1999 and Heckman and Vytlacil 1999. This heterogeneity arises if individuals select theireducation on the basis of their comparative advantages; see Roy 1951, Garen1987 and Willis and Rosen 1979.Estimating a comparative advantage model for schooling with many educational levels the generalized Roy model1, in which returns vary between individuals at each level of education, requires instruments to be specified for each levelof education in order to identify the return parameters, unless very restrictivefunctional form assumptions are imposed. Our main contribution to this literature is to exploit features of different school reforms in Norway to estimate a Roymodel for returns to education in which several levels of education are specified.The main reform we use in our identification strategy is the school reformextending mandatory years of schooling from seven to nine years. This reformtook more than ten years to implement. For those years, we observe the samebirth cohorts going through both types of compulsory school system. In addition,we use sequential education reforms in Norway at the upper secondary, college 1This approach follows Willis and Rosen 1979, Garen 1987, Bjrklund and Moffitt 1987and Heckman and Vytlacil 1999. Papers estimating the returns to education using thisapproach usually specify the Roy model for only two levels of education noncollege and collegedegrees. For models of this kind using discrete outcome variables, see Aakvik et al. 2000,2003.2and university education levels. The identification strategy uses a difference indifferences approach for identification, as in Duflo 2001, to identify the returnto each schooling level. We use as instruments the reform of compulsory schooling and additional information on whether schools were providing the six levelsabove basic schooling in the municipality, and allow for interactions between theavailability of schools at different levels and the compulsory school reform.As well as using detailed data on educational reforms, we exploit an extremelyrich database for Norway consisting of very detailed register information on thehuman capital characteristics of the individuals for the 1948 to 1957 cohorts thatwere exposed to the reforms. We also have detailed background informationon their parents including their education, income, the number of children in thefamily, and the municipality in which they grew up. These data are from the 1960and 1970 Censuses. A feature of the data on employeremployee relationships isexploited when calculating tenure. The net sample comprises 160,000 individualsborn from 1948 to 1957.We assess the effect of the reform on increasing participation rates in highereducation in general. Furthermore, we test whether the increased education dueto the reforms led to higher returns to education. Family background, especiallyfathers and mothers education, is a very important determinant of participationin higher education. We also find that this effect was weaker after the mandatoryschool reform was introduced. When estimating returns to education, we find thatthe returns to education are highly nonlinear and that the Roy model is betterthan a traditional instrumental variables model in which schooling is a continuousvariable. In particular, we find that the returns to upper secondary school and upto two years of education at regional colleges, together with masters programsat universities, have a high return as measured by wages. Also, we find that theaverage treatment effect is surprisingly high for mediumlength education up totwo years of, usually regional, college education. This means that increasing thegeneral level of education, which was the intention of the comprehensive schoolreform of the 1960s and other school reforms, has the potential to generate a highreturn in wages, although we do not consider the cost issue for society. We alsofind that there is a substantial difference between the average treatment effectand the effect of treatment on the treated for bachelors and masters degrees.3Whereas the difference between the average treatment effect and the effect oftreatment on the treated is only a few percentage points for educational levels upto bachelors degree level, the difference in the average treatment effect and theeffect of treatment on the treated is more than 12 percentage points per year forbachelors and masters degrees.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the datasets and defines variables used in the analysis. Section 3 provides backgroundinformation on the school reforms in Norway. Special attention is paid to ouridentification strategy and the robustness of the instruments. Section 4 presentsour econometric framework for estimating the returns to education. Section 5reports the determinants of school choice from the regression analysis. In addition, we report results from earnings regressions and different policy relevantparameters, such as the average treatment effect and the effect of treatment onthe treated, from a model that allows for selection into educational levels on thebasis of comparative advantage. The final section presents our conclusions.2 Data Set and Variables The main data sources for our study are administrative registers from Statistics Norway. Each individual is characterized by his or her personal identity codeand information from different administrative registers is merged for each personin the population. The data set covers persons working in all sectors privatemanufacturing, private services, and the public sector in 1995, for the birthcohorts of 1948 to 1957. For the wage regressions, we use information on experience, seniority, years of education, type of education, annual income, and theemployment relationship. We can calculate seniority and quantify the employment relationships because we have a merged employeremployee data set.In addition to the information on education for each person, we use information on family background for the period in which the person grew up andstarted compulsory education. This includes parents or guardians income, theireducation and municipality and county. This information is from the National Censuses of Population and Housing in 1960 and 1970; see Vassenden 1987.We use both the type and number of years of education received in the empir4ical analysis.Years of education is based on the normal duration of the education.It includes only completed and highest attained education, and all formal education courses exceeding 300 hours are registered. This variable has 14 values fromseven to 20 years of education. Type of education is based on characteristics ofthe Norwegian education system and Statistics Norways standard classificationof education. We group our sample into the seven levels presented in Table I.Table I Definition of education levels applied in the analysisThis method of defining the education categories in Norway is very commonand is used in the Norwegian educational statistics. It reflects the school system and includes vocational schools, upper secondary schools, up to two yearsof education in regional colleges, university degrees of three to four years, anddegrees of five years or more. This classification fits nicely with the Roy modelfor education, assuming that individuals have comparative advantages at certaineducational levels and act on these when choosing education. One would expectthat students primarily think in terms of types of education for instance ofbecoming a history teacher and then perhaps consider years of education forinstance, of becoming a history teacher in the primary school system requiringan undergraduate university degree or of teaching in high school with a graduatelevel degree. A model that specifies the type of education is expected to clarifyresults of student choices based on comparative advantages. Although we haveseven different levels of education, we only have five different types of school.The two vocational levels correspond to the same type of school. In addition,the two upper educational levels correspond to university degrees bachelors andmasters degrees or higher.Annual earnings in 1995 were calculated from annual taxable income as reported in the tax register. Tenure is defined as the number of years spent workingfor the current employer. Work experience is based on the number of years inwhich annual earnings exceed the basic minimum level of the oldage pension.In 1995, this amounted to NOK 40,000 around USD 5000. This is our bestapproximation of the number of years spent in the labor market; see Bratbergand Vaage 2000.5To measure labor market outcomes, we use annual earnings. Furthermore,we restrict our sample to full time workers, defined as those working more than 30 hours a week, since annual earnings is used as the outcome variable. Workersholding multiple jobs, selfemployed workers and workers participating in labormarket programs or receiving unemployment benefits were all excluded from thesample.For family income, we sum the fathers and mothers income in 1970, collectedfrom the Census data. We divide family income into groups based on percentiles.The fathers and mothers education is represented by a dummy variable indicating whether or not they have a college education. The data selection process isillustrated in Table II.Table II Data selection processThe ten different male cohorts born between 1948 and 1957 amount to 295,646individuals. Data on parents is missing for more than 20 percent of the individuals in the sample. Data on parents are important for two reasons. First, theyare used to determine where individuals grew up and in which municipality theywent to school. This is important information because it is used to construct ourinstruments the availability of different types of school. Second, family background variables, such as parental education and income, are important factorsin modeling the level of education. We have removed from the sample individualswith missing parental information from the Census data from 1960 or 1970.When looking at the returns to education, we only use full time workingpersons. We exclude persons in this age cohort who have no work or are workingparttime, or have missing data on tenure. This amounts to about 20 percent ofthe sample. Descriptive statistics for the net sample are provided in Table III.Table III Descriptive statistics for the net sample of 159,452 individualsThe age in 1995 for persons in our sample varies from 38 to 47 years. Meanwork experience is 21 years with a standard deviation of 4, and mean tenure is 7.5 years with a standard deviation of almost 6. Mean years of education is 12.1.Around 10 percent of the sample has a father with a college degree. This is notsurprising since the level of education for persons with children born in the 1950s 6is low. Only 3 percent of the sample has a mother with a college degree. Theavailability of different types of school is an important determinant of educationalchoice. Eighty percent of those in our sample lived in a municipality that offeredvocational training and education. Sixtyeight percent of the sample lived in amunicipality that had upper secondary school. Fortytwo percent had a regionalcollege in the municipality in which they grew up. About 20 percent could go toa university in their home municipality. The universities in Norway are locatedin Oslo, Bergen, Trondheim, and Troms.3 Education in Norway From the 1960s to the 1990s, the Norwegian education system went through several major reforms. The starting point was reforming compulsory primary andjunior secondary schools, which happened primarily in the 1960s, and extendingthe minimum mandatory education period from seven to nine years. During aten year period, two distinct school systems coexisted: there were municipalities with nine years of mandatory schooling and others with only seven years ofcompulsory schooling. The potential effects are expected to be larger and thuseasier to measure in the case of Norway than in most other countries, because the Norwegian reform went further both in unifying the comprehensive school systemand in promoting equality of opportunity; see Leschinsky and Mayer 1990.The reform process then continued to voluntary upper secondary schoolsgymnas in the mid 1970s. At almost the same time, it reached the postupper secondarycollege level, where the reform process lasted until the presentcollege structure was launched in the early 1990s. These reforms are used inthis paper as part of the identification strategy for estimating the returns toeducation. The reform of the mandatory schooling period was probably the mostinfluential, and is closest to being a natural experiment. Hence, it constitutes themain element in our identification strategy. We provide information on the aimsof the reform, procedures for implementing it and how it was financed, etc.73.1 The Mandatory School Reform The mandatory school reform, enacted by the Norwegian Parliament in 1959,was started in 1960, and lasted until 1972.2 The reform extended the number ofcompulsory years of schooling and unified the education system at the tertiarylevel.3 In the Norwegian prereform system, children started school at the ageof seven and finished their compulsory education after seven years, i.e., at theage of 14. The old system had a parallel system of voluntary lower secondaryeducation, comprising two years of junior high school realskole in preparationfor upper secondary school, followed by university education, and the socalledcontinuation school framhaldsskole which prepared students for vocationaltraining and general training outside the systems of higher professional trainingand theoretical education. Selection into junior high school was based on grades,and it was available in some municipalities but not in others. In the new system,the starting age remained at seven years, but the time spent in compulsory education increased to nine years. The nine years were divided into two levels: first,six years of primary school; and second, three years of secondary school, whichprepared students for high school.4The aims of the reform were stated explicitly in several governmental background papers. These were: 1 to increase the minimum level of education insociety by extending the number of compulsory years of education from seven tonine; 2 to smooth the transition to higher education by unifying the education 2See Lov om folkeskolen av 1959 Law on primary schooling. The reform had alreadystarted on a small and explorative basis in the late 1950s, but applied to a negligible number ofstudents because only three municipalities, each with a small number of schools, were involved.See Lie 1974, Telhaug 1969, and Lindbekk 1992, for descriptions of the reform.3Similar school reforms were undertaken in most other European countries in the sameperiod, notably Sweden, the United Kingdom and, to some extent, France and Germany. Meghirand Palme 2003 present results using Swedish data, and Blundell et al. 1997 do so using U.K. data.4The Norwegian school system has been slightly changed recently by the socalled Reform 97. Children now start at the age of six and the time spent in compulsory educationis ten years, of which seven are at primary school and three are at secondary school. In addition, three years are available to all students either preparing for university or for a tradevocational.8system up to secondary education; and 3 to increase equality of opportunityalong socioeconomic and, in particular, geographic lines both by providing resources to establish the new comprehensive schools in all municipalities and bysecuring a common curriculum for all schools.The reform period lasted from 1960 to 1972, when a new law for mandatoryschooling was passed, stating that all municipalities should have introduced thenineyear mandatory school system by 1973. Hence, for more than a decade,the Norwegian compulsory school system was divided into two. The first cohortthat was affected by the reform was the one born in 1947. This cohort startedschool in 1954, and i either finished the prereform compulsory school periodin 1961, or ii went to primary school from 1954 to 1960, then entered the postreform secondary school system from 1960 to 1962. The last cohort to which,in principle, the old system could apply was born in 1959. This cohort startedschool in 1965 and finished compulsory school in 1972.3.1.1 Implementation of the reform The law of 1959 for mandatory schooling established a central administrationagency under the Ministry of Education, The Royal Council for Experimentation in the Schools Forsksradet for skoleverket, to direct the implementationof the reform. It was established to experiment by using innovations in schools.The reform was officially regarded as an experiment in the 1960s until the newlaw for primary schools was enacted in 1969; see Lie 1974. Although the agencywas in charge of the reform, it was the municipalities which is the lowest level ofof local administration that decided whether to implement the reform. The municipalities had to apply to The Royal Council for Experimentation in the Schoolsto implement the new school system for the whole municipality. In 1960, therewere 750 municipalities in Norway.5 In order to apply, the municipalities had topresent a plan for the new school in terms of buildings, teachers, and funding.The law of 1959 made it clear that the extra costs of teachers and buildings werefunded by the state.5In the mid 1960s, the number of municipalities was reduced to about 450. Because weuse the municipalities existing in 1960 to identify the reform municipalites, this change has noeffect for the identification strategy used in this paper.9It is difficult to determine the criteria under which applicants were selected bythe committee. However, the committee wanted to include different communitiesto make the sample representative of the whole country and ensure that the plansfor buildings and so on were acceptable; Telhaug 1969, Medias 2000. Anotherimportant factor for adopting the reforms has been identified by Lie 1973, 1974.The school director at the county level, who is an appointed representative of thestate, played a central role in coordinating the adoption process being undertakenby the state and the municipality. Socalled dynamic school directors playedan important role in getting the reforms adopted.6 This is also supported by thefinding of Lie 1974 that all municipalities within a county tended to implementthe reform at the same time.In the public debate during 1950s and 1960s, it was claimed that the old educational system with more streaming was a better preparation for high schooland university than the new system, indicating that richer and urban areas mayhave been slow to implement the reform. It was also claimed in the public debatethat nine years of mandatory schooling was of less importance in many ruralcommunities, where, since fishing and farming were the main industries, sevenyears of compulsory education was regarded as sufficient. In her contemporarystudy of the reform, Lie 1973, 1974, tested different hypotheses about the diffusion of the reform. For instance, were the richest municipalities the first toimplement the reform? Were cities first? Alternatively, did poorer rural areasimplement the reform first because there were obvious economic incentives to doso? Lies 1973, 1974 finding that neither average earnings, taxable income noreducational levels had an impact on reform adoption is interesting. Her explanation for this finding relates to the subsidies provided by the central government.The main finding in her dissertation is that there appear to be neighbour effects in adoption. When one municipality adopts the reform, adoption spreadsto neighboring municipalities. One explanation for this pattern might be thecoordinating role played by school directors at the county level. Other reformsof communication or coordination between neighboring municipalities were also 6The important role of school directors has been reported in several conversations withpeople who were school administrators during this period, and with researchers from otherfields.10used, including regular meetings between politicians in the same county. Anotherexplanation could be that neighboring municipalities share the same characteristics such as income levels, education levels, and political preferences. This is trueto some extent because education levels and incomes are regionally dispersed.However, regions in the far east, north, west and south of the country all havelow and high incomes and education levels, so that neighboring municipalitiesinclude both rich and poor. In sum, Lies research supports a complex adoptionprocess without finding support for single important factor to explain the implementation process. In Section 3.2, we undertake a more formal evaluation of thereform as an instrument in the earnings equations that we estimate.3.1.2 Identification of pupils school reform status Information on the type of school attended is not available at the individual level,except for those who left school with the minimum level of educational attainment seven or nine years. In order to classify individuals and neighborhoodsaccording to a beforeafterreform indicator, we identify the implementation yearat the municipality level. This indicator is constructed as follows. From the 1960census population, we restrict our attention to those individuals for whom we canclearly identify the type of compulsory schooling attained. For each cohort andmunicipality, we count the number of people in each group. If there were no geographical mobility and the reform implemented in a clearcut way, there wouldbe no overlap of observations. However, because some people move, and henceattend school in other municipalities, and the reform was implemented graduallyin some places, we need to examine the relative numbers of graduates from theold and the new systems.Since the number of people who left school with only the mandatory level ofeducation is likely to be affected by the reform, we cannot compare the numberof people with seven years of school with the number of people with nine yearsof school as their final attainment. Therefore, we define two intermediatemeasures of a switching cohort, from which the final indicator is constructed.First, we calculate the average rate at which students leave with only seven yearsin the 1946 to 1948 cohort 7 in a given municipality. When the yearly fraction 7For the identification of the reform year, we exploit information on all cohorts exposed to 11of people who finish with seven years of school drops below this benchmarkby 50 percent, it is a possible indication that the reform has been implemented.Similarly, we calculate the average rate at which students leave with only nineyears of school in the 1957 to 1959 cohort. When the yearly fraction of studentswho leave with only nine years of school reaches 50 percent of this rate is anotherindicative measure. The two switching indicators are then used to define theyear of implementation as follows. When the two coincide, this is our estimateof reform implementation. If there is a gap between them of one or two years,so that it seems that those with seven years of school finished before those withnine years of school started, we use the indicator of nine years as our estimate.For the case of a oneyear overlap, so that it seems that those with nine yearsof school started before those with seven years of school finished, we manuallychecked all the larger municipalities more than 100 students against Ness 1971and local informants. For smaller municipalities with a oneyear overlap betweenthe possible indicators, we have randomly assigned one of the candidates as ourestimate of the reform year. We have dropped from the sample the municipalitiesfor which our two indicators diverge by more than two years and those for whichmanual assignment of the larger municipalities did not work. This procedureprovides a unique estimate of the year of implementation transformed into abirth cohort by subtracting 13 for 545 of the 728 municipalities.8 See Raaumet al. 2003 for the relative importance of these rules as applied to the data.Although there will certainly be some measurement error in our reform date takenas a flow indicator of reforms, we expect that any measurement error in the stockof reformed and nonreformed municipalities, for a given year, would be small.The implementation profile is displayed in Figure I and illustrates the gradualchange in compulsory schooling in Norway for pupils and municipalities.Figure I Implementation of the reformthe reform, even though we have restricted our samples to the 1948 to 1957 cohort in the restof the study.8We also tested different ways of defining reform indicators and restricting the sample,including taking out problematic municipalities, taking out problematic cohorts, and usingsimpler definitions of indicators. The results are robust to these variations.123.1.3 High school, college and university reforms The reform of upper secondary schools took place in the mid 1970s. At thesame time, the post upper secondarycollege level was reorganized, in whichthe reform process lasted until the present college structure was launched inthe early 1990s. All of these reforms will be used as part of the identificationstrategy for estimating returns to education using the Roy model. The reformof compulsory schooling is also used as a basis for the instrument in this modelin which we estimate returns to types of education, by allowing for interactionsbetween the availability of schools at higher education levels and the compulsoryschool reform. Variation in the availability of different upper secondary schoolsand collegesuniversities is partly explained by educational reforms that led toan expansion in the number of schools. However, most of the variation is alongthe crosssectional dimension. Hence, these instruments are to be interpretedprimarily as the distance to education; see Card 1995.We have constructed a database that assigns different types of educationalinstitutions to the different municipalities.9 Combined with our information onthe municipalities in which the individuals grew up, we are able to construct avariable that indicates whether an individual had access to different educationallevels in the same municipality. Table IV illustrates availability for the oldest,the median, and the youngest cohort, represented by the fraction of individuals,with access.Table IV Availability of different schools. Individual dataTable V illustrates availability for the oldest, the median, and the youngestcohorts, represented by the fraction of municipalities.Table V Availability of different schools in municipalities. N435Both methods of calculating availability show an increase in the density ofall schools over time. Obviously, the largest effect is for the compulsory schools,9For the period 1974 to 1992, Statistics Norway provides data in electronic format. Forearlier years, we have collected data from issues of Norwegian Educational Statistics variousyears. Years after 1992 were not regarded as relevant, since not even the youngest cohort inquestion 1957 was considered to be in education.13which form the main part of our identification strategy. As for levels higher thancompulsory school, important reforms have taken place in the previous decades,all of which to some extent were intended to make schools available in moremunicipalities, or to more individuals. For example, between 1961 and 1970,there was a six percent increase in the number of municipalities providing uppersecondary schools, which meant that this level of education was available withinthe municipalities to 71 percent of the individuals in the 1957 cohort, comparedwith 65 percent in the 1948 cohort. However, our data also allow us to exploitthe variation between municipalities. The fractions reported in Tables IV and Vreveal that this variation is even greater than the variation over time.3.2 Evaluation of the Instruments In this section, we discuss the validity of the instruments on the basis of twostandard criteria: i their impact on the variables for which they serve asinstruments; and ii their independence of the error term.3.2.1 Impact of comprehensive reform Table VI reports the unconditional proportion of persons in different qualificationgroups by reform status, and the difference in educational attainment betweenthe two subsamples.Table VI Observed distribution of qualification levels by reform statusComparing pre and postreform samples, there is a distinct decrease 6.4 percentage points in the proportion of individuals with compulsory education only.For the remaining levels, educational attainment is higher for prereform thanpostreform individuals, particularly for lower educational levels. For example,the proportion of people with upper secondary school is 4.4 percent for the prereform sample, and 5.5 percent for the postreform period, which is an increaseof more than 22 percent. The only exception is the highest level of education,where attainment is lower for the postreform sample; however, the difference isnot significant.14Note, however, that the cohorts in question all experienced a major expansionof the general education system. The numbers in Table VI are unconditional ofthis trend. Because the reform was implemented sequentially from 1959 to 1973,the fraction of individuals with postreform compulsory education is higher inyounger cohorts. Furthermore, the 1960s was a period of major change in themunicipality structure, including changes in the localization of schools. Consequently, cohorts and regions should be controlled for. Two other sources frequently debated in the literature, see for instance Card 1999, are differencesin ability and differences in liquidity constraints. Unfortunately, direct information on ability exam scores , IQtests, etc. is very limited in Norway, andis not included in our data set. On the other hand, our data is rich in othertypes of background information, such as family income and education, and hasinformation on the individuals parents.To evaluate the reforms impact on educational attainment conditional onthese arguments, we estimate an ordered probit model for levels of education. Theexplanatory variables included in the schooling equation are cohort dummies tencohorts, dummy variables for geographical location 19 counties, family incomein 1970 quartiles and the level of education for mothers and fathers dummyvariables for college education.The parameter estimates from the ordered probit model are presented anddiscussed in Section 5.1. Here, we report predicted pre and postreform educationlevels.Table VII Predicted distribution of qualification levels by reform statusIt is clear that the reform, taking account of the positive trend in educationalattainment, parents income, etc., had an impact, particularly at the lower levelsof higher education. We find counterintuitive responses at the highest levels ofeducation, i.e., for the second highest and the highest levels of education bachelors and masters degrees. This indicates that the reform produced a smallfraction of defiers; i.e., individuals who would have attained the highest levelof education under the old system, but fail to do so under the new system. Thisresult should be interpreted with care, however. Reform of comprehensive schools 15is likely to be a poor predictor of the highest levels of education, and the reporteddecrease in attainment might be coincidental rather than systematic.Reform of compulsory schooling is used as the single instrument only in thetraditional earningschooling equation, in which the schooling variable is treatedas a continuous variable. This model is discussed in Section 4.1. To take intoaccount possible nonlinearities as well as observed and unobserved heterogeneity,we estimate a Roy model in which we use education as a discrete variable insteadof education as a continuous variable. The Roy model is discussed in Section 4.2. To identify the returns to education in this model, we need an instrumentfor each level of education. We use variation in availability of different postcompulsory schools as part of our identification strategy. We use the availabilityof these schools interacted with the reform of compulsory schooling dummy asour instrument; see for instance Duflo 2001. We illustrate the idea behindthe use of this differenceindifferences strategy with a twobytwo table for eachtype of school. The table shows the average number of years of education 10 forindividuals in municipalities that introduced the mandatory school reform andthose that did not, and in municipalities in which all other types of schools wereavailable and in those in which they were not.Table VIII.1VIII.4 Means of education by school availabilityThe tables show that the average number of years of educational attainmentis higher in municipalities that introduced the reform that increased mandatoryeducation to nine years, but it also shows that the average length of educationincreased more in municipalities with schools providing higher education. Thedifference in these differences can be interpreted as the causal effect of the educational reforms, under the assumption that the mean years of education wouldhave been the same in areas with and without the higher educational institutions.On average, the effect of the reform in terms of the increase in the duration of education is 0.21 years in municipalities without vocational schools, and 0.20 yearsfor municipalities that did offer this form of education. The difference, 0.01 years,10We use years of education in these tables for convenience only. In our model, we use thelevel of education, rather than years of education, but to present Table VIII using levels ofeducation would produce 28 different tables, which we do not report here.16is approximately the same for municipalities with and without upper secondaryschools, whereas it is distinctly higher, almost 0.17 years, for the highest levelof education University II. The only exception to this pattern is the secondhighest level University I, i.e., regional colleges, where the effect of the reformis higher for municipalities not providing this form of education.113.2.2 Testing the instrument We now turn to a formal treatment of the question raised in Section 3.1.1, namely,whether it is possible to treat the reform as a natural experiment. If the implementation of the reform was not random across municipalities, a principalmethodological problem occurs if we want to use the reform as an instrument. Inother words, it rests on the assumption that the comprehensive school reform wasintroduced randomly and not systematically by, for instance, being introducedfirst in rich municipalities. If it relied on local financing, more affluent municipalities could have afforded to select themselves into the reform at an early stage.Children in these municipalities would have been more likely to become bettereducated and earn more as adults. Hence, we need to explore whether the reformimplementation is correlated with municipality characteristics that might haveindirect effects on earnings.In Table IX we regress the year of implementation against different background variables based on municipality averages, such as parental income andthe level of education, age, size of the municipality, etc.Table IX Implementation of reform. Regression. Cohort 19481957It seems reasonable to conclude that there is no systematic pattern in theintroduction rate in relation to parental average earnings, education levels andage, or in relation to urbanrural location. When controlling for localizationusing dummy variables indicating the respective counties, we find none of the 11This finding does not contradict the results in Tables VI and VII, which show that thereform had no effect on the highest level of education, measured using the fraction of individualsthat completed degrees. What we report in Table VIII.4, is that the reform had an effect inthe average duration of education for all inhabitants in those municipalities that offered thehighest forms of education.17other variables are statistically significant. Hence, the reform assignment appearsto be determined exogenously, at least with respect to factors that are testablewith our data.Although an even development of the reform by cityrural, richpoor areaswas wanted by the reform committee, and we do not find any pattern, we cannotcompletely rule out the allocation being systematic in relation to relevant factors.For instance, systematic action on behalf of parents migration to municipalitieswith the preferred education system, etc. cannot be totally ruled out. We have,however, reason to believe that this is a minor problem and, hence, we ignore itin this study; see the discussion in Telhaug 1969.4 The Model We estimate two models for the returns to education; one in which schooling istreated as a continuous variable, and one in which we estimate the returns todifferent levels or types of education. There are several reasons for estimatingreturns to years of education. First, most studies of the returns to educationdefine education in terms of the number of years spent in school. Thus, tocompare our results with previous studies, we define schooling as a continuousvariable. Second, the interpretation of the return to schooling is easier if schoolingis continuous since the number of estimated parameters is reduced.However, there are strong arguments for treating schooling as discrete. First,evidence on the returns to education indicates nonlinearities; see LayneFarraret al.1996 and Bound and Jaeger 1996. A model in which schooling istreated as a continuous variable implies that returns to schooling are assumedto be identical for each level of education, which is clearly more restrictive thana specification allowing for nonlinearities. Second, treating schooling as discreteallows us to specify a comparative advantage model. In such a model, the effectsof both observed and unobserved factors are different for each educational level,thus allowing for heterogeneity in the returns to education.In the generalized Roy model comparative advantage model we have L potential outcomes associated with each level of education: y 1i, y 2i,  , y Li, where yliis the outcome for person i if this person takes educational level l. The returns 18to education in the Roy model are the outcome log earnings given the educational level l minus the outcome this person would have had with compulsoryeducation: yli y 1i. This quantity is never observed directly. However, givena flexible model that accounts for both observed Xi and unobserved Uli selection into different educational levels, we can predict the outcome for a personunder different educational levels. We then average the individual returns overa given population, such as the total population for the average treatment effect or the subpopulation of persons that obtained educational level l for thetreatment effect on the treated.We estimate two models for returns to education: one linear and continuousin education, and one allowing for nonlinearities and heterogeneity in the returnsto education. The two models are analyzed within quite different framework andthe second model is specified as an extended Roy model. For both models, weconsider a model of log annual earnings y in 1995 and analyze only full timeemployed male workers. Thus, we do not look at females and we do not considerthe selection of persons into full time work, part time work or no work.4.1 Education as a Continuous Variable 4.1.1 Educational attainment We allow for heterogeneity in the individual returns to schooling and in theindividual costs of schooling. The optimal level of schooling in the heterogeneitymodel is, see for instance Card 1995:Si bi rik,1where bi is individual ability that generates heterogeneity in the marginal returnsto schooling, ri represents individual differences in opportunities that generateheterogeneity in the marginal cost of schooling, and k is a nonnegative constant.The school reforms may affect both bi and ri.We use an ordered probit model to estimate the effect of control variables andschool reforms on completed school outcomes. The ordered probit model is builtaround a latent regression equation,Si Qi S SZi Vi,219where Si represents the optimal level or type of schooling, Qi is a vector of individual and family background variables, S is the effect of observed backgroundvariables on educational attainment, Zi is the instrument used in this specification school reform, S is the effect of the instrument on educational attainment,and Vi is the error term distributed normally with EV 0 and V arV 1.We do not observe the latent variable Si . However, the observed optimal choiceof education can be modeled in the following way:Si l if cl 1 Si cl,where l 1, 2, . . . , L are educational levels and cl are cutoff levels in the orderedprobit model. We have divided qualification levels into seven discrete categoriesas defined in Table I, i.e. L 7.12 We define c 0 and c L ; i.e.,the two extreme categories 1 and L are openended intervals. From the orderedprobit model, we can predict the probability of a person attaining the differentqualification levels. Thus, we predict PrSi lQi, Zi for all persons in thesample, and from different versions of this equation. In the ordered probit model,PrSi lQi, Zi is calculated as PrSi lQi, Zi cl Qi S Zi S cl 1 Qi S Zi S,where is the cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution.3From the ordered probit model, we calculate the generalized residual foreach level of education l. We call the generalized residual and this new variable is used to model unobservables in the earnings equations. The s for eacheducational level are calculated as follows:li cl 1 Qi S Zi S cl Qi S Zi Scl Qi S Zi S cl 1 Qi S Zi S,4where is the probability density function of the normal distribution.12We also tested a model with 14 different educational groups based on the number of yearsof schooling. This variable varies from seven years of schooling to 20 years of schooling. Alinear regression model of the number of years of education gives the same results as an orderedprobit model if the cutoff levels are the same distance apart. Here, we use an ordered probitmodel even in the case in which S is treated as continuous in the earnings equations.20As explanatory variables, Q, in the ordered probit model, with which wepredict educational outcomes, we use agecohort dummies, dummy variables forchildhood geographical location 19 counties, fathers and mothers income in 1970 quartiles, and fathers and mothers education whether they have collegedegrees or not. Z is the instrument we use reform of the compulsory schoolsystem. We estimate two versions of the ordered probit model: one in which weuse only the reform of compulsory schooling, and the other in which we interactall the background variables with the instrument Q Z, to allow the instrumentto affect the level of schooling differently in terms of family and individual background variables. In Section 4.2, in which we estimate a comparative advantagemodel, Z is a vector of instruments different school reforms.4.1.2 Earnings specification We consider a model of log earnings of the following form:yi i Xi b Si5where i is a personspecific constant, b is the effect of schooling, S is the continuous schooling variable, and X is a vector that includes the following variablesin addition to the Q vector in the first step: tenure, tenure squared, actual workexperience, actual work experience squared, and location when adult 19 counties.Equation 5 does not take into account the possibility of heterogeneity in thereturns to education.13 However, the model allows individual heterogeneity toaffect the intercept of the earnings equation through i. A model that incorporates heterogeneity in the returns to education can be specified by splitting b intotwo parts, b b bi, where b is the common average return to education and biis the random return parameter for number of years of schooling, which we allowto vary from person to person. We split i into two parts, where i a 0 ai.We rewrite equation 5 as follows:613However, it is possible to estimate heterogeneity in returns to education on observableswith this model by allowing for interactions between education and observable characteristics.yi a 0 Xi b biSi ai,21where bi represents heterogeneity in the returns to education, and ai is heterogeneity that affects the level of earnings. Both bi and ai are unobserved variables.There are two potential sources of bias in equation 6. The first is thestandard ability bias problem, which is due to the correlation between ai and Si.The second is due to heterogeneity in the returns to education, which is due tothe correlation between bi and Si. We use a control function approach to modelthe effect of unobserved factors. We assumeand EaiSi, Qi, Zi i EbiSi, Qi, Zi i,where Covai, SiV arSi and Covbi, SiV arSi. The variable i isin this case pooled over each educational level since we are analyzing the case inwhich S is continuous. Hence, we have the following earnings equation :EyiXi, Si, i a 0 Xi b Si i Si i;7see Card 1999, 2001, and Wooldridge 2003. Applying OLS to equation 7yields a consistent estimate of the average effect of schooling on earnings. Wealso estimate an instrumental variables IV version of this model, which doesnot allow for heterogeneity in the returns to education:EyiXi, Si, i a 0 Xi b Si i.8The model in equation 8 is used as a benchmark against which other modelsare compared.4.2 A Model of Comparative Advantage We now turn to estimation when education is measured as a discrete variable. Inthe first stage of the model, that of estimating the school choice model, we use asequential probit model. From this model, we estimate an endogeneity correctionterm, which is used in the estimation of the Roy model. This correction term isallowed to work differently for each educational level.224.2.1 Educational attainment The sequential probit model can be used when the dependent variable the levelof schooling can be separated into a sequence of binary choices; see for instance Heckman and Cameron 1998. This is an alternative to the ordered probitmodel used in Section 4.1, and allows for the flexible estimation of educationalattainment. We use the simplest version of the model in which the error termis independent across sequences, mainly because of identification issues; see forinstance Taber 2000.In the model of educational choice, we have L levels of education. Schoolchoice is represented by a set of discrete variables: D1i, D2i, , DLi, where Dliis the discrete outcome for person i if this person has finished educational levell 1. Dli 1 if a person completes grade l and Dli 0 otherwise. In the firstchoice education beyond compulsory education, i.e., educational level 2, we let D2i represent a discrete choice. In the secondchoice stage, we let D3i representa discrete binary choice only when D2i 1, etc.For the first stage, we write D1i Qi S1 S1Zi V1i, where we observe D1i 1D1i 0; hence, PrD1i 1Qi, Zi Qi S1 S1Zi. Estimation isby standard maximum likelihood on the full sample. For the second stage, weuse Bayes formula to formulate PrD1i 1, D2i 1Qi, Zi PrD1i 1Qi, Zi PrD2i 1D1i 1, Qi, Zi.We write D2i Qi S2 S2Zi V2i where we observe D2i 1D2i 0; hence,PrD2i 1Qi, Zi Qi S2 S2Zi. Estimation is by standard maximumlikelihood on the selected sample. We continue this strategy up to the last educational level DLi. Since we have seven different educational levels, to estimatethe model, we assume independence between the error terms in the differentspecifications.The vector of instruments, Z, includes the availability of different types ofschools at the municipality level. In particular, we use interaction terms betweenthe reform of compulsory schooling and changes in the availability of other typesof school as identifying exclusion restrictions. Our specification requires that wehave a valid instrument at each level of education. Variables and instrumentsused in the regressions are discussed in Sections 2 and 3.234.2.2 The Roy model The most flexible method of allowing both for nonlinearities in the returns toeducation and for heterogeneity in returns, is to specify a Roy model for eachlevel of education using an identifying instrument for each education level. Weuse a switching regression framework, in which earnings regressions are estimatedfor each educational level,; see for instance Heckman, Tobias, and Vytlacil 2000.The advantage of using such a framework is that the returns to education areallowed to vary both in terms of observed and unobserved individual factors.This is a demanding framework in the sense that it requires many observationsto avoid the problem of missing cells.The model has the regression specification EyliXi, li, Dli 1 a 0 Xil lli9for each educational level l. The results from these different regressions can beused to predict the outcome for educational levels other than the one that is observed for individual i. The return to education is then the outcome of schoolinglevel l relative to another schooling level, such as schooling level 1, which is compulsory schooling. Thus, the effect of schooling level l is the difference betweenthe predicted outcome for person i given schooling level l and the predicted outcome for the same person had he or she had only compulsory schooling. Thereturn to schooling is then an average of these differences. For instance, if weaverage over the whole population, we get the average treatment effect ATE.If we average over the subsample of persons with the exact schooling level l, weget the effect of treatment on the treated TT. The TT parameter given specificvalues of X and S is given by T T Sl,x xil 1 l 1 li.10The parameters and come from the estimation of equation 9 for each educational level, and is calculated from a sequence of probit regression models.Unconditioned estimates of equation 10, i.e. T T Sl, can be found by integrating T T Sl,x over the distribution of X.Both the TT and the ATE are relevant policy parameters in our application inwhich we are analyzing reforms such as comprehensive school reform. The ATE24parameter gives the effect of selecting at random a person from the populationinto a different educational level than the one in which that person is observed.We can thus predict the effect of school reforms that are intended to increase thelevel of education in the population as a whole. The effect of the TT parameter isa relevant policy parameter when calculating the returns to schooling for a groupof individuals with a particular level of education.Return parameters in the Roy model, such as the one given in equation 10,have two heterogeneity components. The first is related to observable variables.In equation 10, the effects of observed individual and family background variables xi are allowed to be different for different schooling levels. Thus, theeffect of, for instance, family income during childhood is allowed to be differentfor different educational levels. Second, the effect of unobservables i is alsoallowed to be different for different schooling levels. Thus, the effect of, for instance, unobserved ability can vary between educational levels. We now have acomparative advantage model in terms of both observed and unobserved factors,in which individuals are allowed to act on their differences. This comparative advantage model or Roy model is challenging since we need to estimate earningsequations for each educational level. The estimation of treatment effects can besensitive to imprecise parameter estimates in the earnings equation.5 Results 5.1 Estimating Educational Attainment As noted in Section 3.2.1, we wish to establish the effect of reform of compulsory schooling on educational attainment. Table X reports the ordered probitcoefficients for the school choice level of education, in which, as well as addingthe dummy for the oldnew regime, we have controlled for a broad range ofdemographic and socioeconomic covariates, the most interesting being parentaleducation and income. Model 1 in Table X is the basic model which includescohort and county dummies whose coefficients are not reported to save space.In Model 2 in Table X, the reform dummy is interacted with all the variables of 25Model 1.14Table X Educational choice. Ordered probit modelIn addition to the estimated coefficients, we calculate the effects of changesin the covariates on the probabilities of the respective education levels, reportedin Table XI.Table XI Effects on cell probability choice of changes in covariatesFirst, we note from Table X that pupils from the reformed compulsory schoolsgenerally have a significantly higher level of education than those from the nonreformed. The magnitude of the effect is illustrated in Table XI. Postreform pupilsare about 4.5 percent less likely to choose the lowest level of education comparedwith the prepupil group, and about 3 percent more likely to choose the highestlevel.Parental education appears to be a strong predictor of the educational choiceof the children.If a childs father has a college education, the probability ofthe child leaving school with only compulsory education Level 1 is reduced byalmost 20 percent, and the probability of attaining a masters degree Level 7increases by more than 12 percent. Note, however, that this dependence on thefathers education is lower for the postreform group than the prereform groupby 3 percent at the bottom and 2 percent at the top. The effect of the motherseducation shows the same pattern, with the magnitude being slightly smaller, asis the change from the old to the new system.Parental income the sum of the fathers and mothers income is included inthe form of quartiles, the lowest quartile being used as a reference. As expected,higher parental income appears to raise the level of the childs education. Theeffect increases from being quite modest for the second quartile to being quitelarge for the fourth. The changes from the old to the new system is less apparent,14We report the results from the ordered probit model using only one instrument reform ofcompulsory schooling since we use this specification when estimating the model when schoolingis treated as a continuous variable; see section 4.1. For the model described in Section 4.2, weuse several school reforms and interactions between them in our identification strategy; however,the results from these regressions are not reported here.26but seem to suggest a reduced dependence on parental income for the upperquartile; see Table XI. The results of Table XI are depicted in Figures II to VII.Figures II to VII Marginal effects in the ordered probit modelThe steepness indicates the respective variables influence on educationalchoice, and the difference between the solid and dotted lines indicates the effect of the reform.5.2 Results from Estimation of the Wage Equation In this section, we present the results from the estimated wage equations forthe different models. We start with the model in which education is treated asa continuous variable and present results from OLS, IV selection model andrandom coefficient models. Then we present the results for the model in whicheducation is treated as a discrete variable representing the type of education.In this model, we allow for differences in returns for different educational levels.The model also allows for heterogeneity in terms of observed and unobservedvariables.5.2.1 Constant returns to years of education In Table XII, we report the results of the earnings equation in which we assumeconstant returns to education by specifying the education variable as a continuousvariable.Table XII Earnings equations, fulltime employed men, cohorts 19481957In column 1, we tabulate the OLS returns to education for male workers forall sectors. Note that we are estimating the wage equation on the birth cohorts 19481957, which means that they are 3847 years of age in 1995. Since primeage males are used, returns to education are higher than if we were to use a widerage range. The returns to education using OLS are 7.5 percent.1515In the model in which education is treated as a continuous variable, we have two versions ofthe model. First, we use the actual number of years of education, which ranges from seven to 2027In column 2, results controlling for the endogeneity of education are presentedin which reform of compulsory schooling is used as the identifying instrument.The model used in column 2 is a standard selection model; see equation 8 in Section 4.1.2. The results show that returns to education increase to 10.2 percent. This is a standard result from, for instance the literature using a measureof distance to higher education as an instrument see Card 1995, 1999 and for Norway see Hgeland et al. 1999. It indicates heterogeneity in returns toeducation in that the instrument we use picks up the returns to education forthe group that complies with the treatment reform of compulsory schooling. Inthis case, it is reasonable to suppose that the compliers, who were being pushedto higher educational attainment when the new compulsory school system wasintroduced, have higher returns to schooling compared with those groups thatwere unaffected by the reform for instance, the always takers and never takers. The reform may thus have affected both the return and cost parametersin equation 1, with some feedback to the level of education. The LATE interpretation of returns to education, which is the interpretation of IV estimatesin the case of discrete instrumental variables see Angrist et al. 1996 is thatour estimated parameter of returns to education is the returns to education fora person acquiring an extra year of education just because of the educational reform and who would have dropped out of education after seven years otherwise.This result contrasts with that from a similar specification in Meghir and Palme2003, who find no significant effect on returns to education using participationin the reform of compulsory schooling as the instrument.years. Second, we use the level of education, but treat this variables as a continuous variable.This variable has seven levels values. We do this to compare our results with the results inwhich education is a discrete variable in Section 5.2.2. In Table XII, we report the results forthe model in which we use seven levels of education, rather than the model with the actualnumber of years of education. The results from the regressions that use the actual numberof years of education are available upon request. The results from this model are comparableto the one reported here, although the increase in the IV return parameter compared with the OLS estimates are smaller than the one reported in Table XII. The OLS estimate of the returnsto education for the model not reported here is 5 percent, which is in accordance with resultsfrom other studies in Norway; see Hgeland et al. 1999, Hgeland 2001, Raaum and Aab2000.28The standard interpretation of the IV results indicates that it is pupils withpoor family backgrounds or pupils with long travel distances to the nearest schoolsthat are identified when using the school reform as an instrument. This was oneof the groups particularly targeted by the government when it introduced thereform. The interpretation that credit constraints matter has been challengedin recent papers; see Carneiro and Heckman 2002 and Carneiro et al. 2001.In these papers, Heckman and his coauthors find support for the notion that,for the United States, income constraints on families cannot explain the results.They emphasize longrun factors such as parental guidance and the genes thatform the cognitive and noncognitive abilities of children and which are correlatedwith longrun parental income.For a third specification, we estimate the random coefficient model in whichthe interpretation is an average effect since both endogeneity and heterogeneityare purged from the wage equation. The estimation follows from equation 7in Section 4.1.2. The return to education is now 6.3 percent on average perunit of education, which is slightly lower than in the OLS specification as wellas the selection result reported in column 2 of Table XII. If we interpret thisresult literally, it means that the returns to education in the population arelower when heterogeneity and endogeneity is controlled for.In our case, thisimplies that there must have been a slight positive selection into higher educationcaused by the reform because the average return to education is lower when thisis controlled for. This result is in line with the LATE result obtained fromthe IV estimates presented in column 2, in which the results indicate positiveselection into higher education. We also note that the interaction term betweenthe selection parameter, , and years of education is negative in this model,pointing in the same direction.5.2.2 Returns to education levels In Table XIII, we first present the regression results from the estimated Roymodel for returns to education by defining education in terms of qualificationlevels from one year of vocational training to masters degree level; see equation9 in Section 4.2.2. The reference level is compulsory education; see also Table I for definitions of education levels applied in the analysis.29Table XIII Earnings equations, full time employed men. Roy modelThe table shows that earnings increase with work experience, but at a decreasing rate, at all educational levels. The effect of tenure is the same as that ofwork experience, but the effect is smaller in magnitude. Note that the effect ofone more year of work experience on earnings is much higher for the two highestlevels of education university degrees than is the effect on lower levels of education. The effect of family background characteristics on earnings is much smallerthan the effect of these variables on educational attainment. The effect of havinga mother with a college education is about the same as the effect of one moreyear of work experience. Note also that the effect on earnings of having a motherwith a college education is larger than the effect of having a father with a collegeeducation. Only 10 percent of the sample had a father with college education,and only 3 percent had a mother with college education; see Table III. The effectof family income on earnings is clearly positive as we go from the first incomequartile to the second. This applies for all educational levels. However, the effectof moving to a higher family income quartile is less clear, and is negative for thehighest educational levels. The effect of the selection correction term of movingfrom one educational level to the next is negative for all educational levels. However, the effect is not significantly different from zero for the four highest levelsof education in this specification.We now turn to the estimation of returns to different levels of education; see Table XIV. The estimation of different return parameters is based on equation10 in Section 4.2.2. The coefficient estimates from Table XIII are used to formthe l and l coefficients in equation 10.Table XIV Returns to education. Effects are measured in percentWe report the unconditioned mean log earnings and differences in returns toeducation in the first two columns. The unconditioned results show that uppersecondary school generates a 24 percent return for the three years of education.Two to three years of vocational training gives a much lower return of about 8.6 percent, and one year of vocational training yields a return of about onepercent. Note that undergraduate regional college or short university degrees 30do not give a much higher return compared with that given by upper secondaryschool on the basis of the unconditional estimates; in fact, it gives a loss in onecase. This nonlinearity in returns is a striking result and has been noted before;see Hgeland, Klette and Salvanes 1999.16 The return to a masters degree is 45 percent relative to that of compulsory school. All these results compare wellwith the results of others; for instance, for Sweden see Edin and Holmlund 1997and Meghir and Palme 2003.The next two columns provide the ATE results and the TT effect allowingfor selection on observable and unobservable background characteristics withinthe comparative advantage model; see Section 4.2. The results are similar tothe unconditioned results, but there are slight differences. First, notice that thereturns to upper secondary school are lower when measured as an ATE thanare the unconditional averages in the population. The Roy model predicts anaverage effect of a 20 percentage point gain in earnings each year from having anupper secondary school diploma. Second, adjusting for observed and unobservedselection, we find that the average effect of higher education is higher than thatimplied by the unconditional estimates. Nonlinearities in the average returns toeducation remain, but are less apparent than in the unconditional case.Moving to the results for the TT effect, the final column in Table XIV showsthat these effects provide higher returns at all levels than the ATE and unconditional effects, except at the vocational level. This means that selection intohigher education is important. The TT effect results indicate strongly that returns to education are high for higher education. Considering the ATE results,which we can interpret as the result of an experiment of putting the whole population into a particular level of education, the return to education is lower thanfor those students at that education level. This result implies that selection oncomparative advantage is also important because the returns due to selection intodifferent education levels are important. This finding supports earlier findings in 16Note that these categories of 12 years and especially 34 years of collegeuniversity degreescomprise many different types of education, as one year of university without a degree via twoyears of a college degree to a fouryear university degree both in universities cand.mag.inthe Norwegian system, or a degree from a technical university and a degrees from a businessschool, which are difficult to enter on the basis of high school marks. Hgeland 2000 hasanalyzed this in detail and the difference in returns is noticeable.31the literature that test for only two levels of education; see Willis and Rosen1979 and Garen 1984.From the final column of Table XIV, we find that the effect of a bachelorsdegree level 6 is considerably higher for those actually taking a bachelors degree than the effect of randomly selecting a person into that particular level ofeducation. In addition, the effect of randomly selecting a person into upper secondary school or a short college programs one and two year programs, ATE,gives a surprisingly high effect. Thus, increasing the general level of education,the intention of the comprehensive school reform in the 1960s and also of otherschool reforms, has the potential of giving a high return in wages up to the levelof short college programs, although we do not consider the cost issue for society.We also find that there is a substantial difference between the ATE and the TTfor bachelors and masters degrees at universities. Thus, selection effects areimportant for university degrees.6 Concluding Remarks In this paper, we have used a rich data set and a flexible framework for estimating the returns to education. We have studied different return parametersof education, both in a linear and nonlinear framework, in which we allow theeffect of education to vary both in terms of observed and unobserved factors.The model allows agents to act on the effect of schooling and, hence, we haveassumed forward looking agents who can predict the effects of different schoolinglevels on wage outcomes. Supply side shocks are useful instruments in demandtype models and we explored the use of educational reforms as instruments inidentifying and interpreting different return parameters of education.We found that the returns to education are strongly nonlinear and that, because of nonlinearities, the Roy model is better than the traditional IV model inwhich schooling is a continuous variable. In particular, we found that the returnsto upper secondary school and one and two years of education at regional colleges,together with masters programs at universities, have a high return as measuredby wages. Also, we find that the average treatment effect, the effect of randomlyselecting a person, is surprisingly high for mediumlength education up to two 32years of college education. This means that increasing the general level of education, the intention of the comprehensive school reform in the 1960s and otherschool reforms, has the potential of giving a high return in wages, although wedo not consider the issue of the cost to society.References1 Aakvik, Arild 2001 Bounding a Matching Estimator: The Case of a Norwegian Training Program, Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics,631, 115143.2 Aakvik, Arild, James J.
