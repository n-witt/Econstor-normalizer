Different national governments with a certain degree ofstabilization power confront the problem of having lost their monetary and exchange ratepolicy, whereas the central bank develops a common monetary policy upon the basis of theaggregates of the currency area. Thus, common monetary policy will not fit the interests ofat least part of the member countries and, moreover, it can be a potential source of asymmetries when the response to a common monetary shock is different among the members ofthe currency area.1Optimum currency area OCA theory put forward by Mundell 1961 predicts that this institutional architecture must rely on strong integration in different economic aspects OCAcriteria such as mobility of labour force, economic openness, financial integration, flexibilityof prices and wages, similarity of inflation rates, diversification in production and consumption, fiscal integration and political integration see Tavlas, 1993, or Mongelli, 2002, or Dellas and Tavlas, 2009, for surveys. When asymmetric shocks hit the national economiesforming a currency union, moving away from equilibrium, these OCA prerequisites becomethe channel for adjustment towards the equilibrium. The higher the level of integration orflexibility in those criteria, the quicker and more complete the adjustment, and the moreoptimal the currency union. Those OCA criteria are typically summarized by means of thesynchronization of business cycles of the members forming the currency area. Furthermore,the empirical literature evaluating the optimality of currency areas has focused on synchronization of shocks andor business cycles with the aim of analyzing the optimality of EMUor the net benefit of joining the EMU for potential members. In so far as shocks are lessasymmetric or cyclical developments are more synchronized, common monetary policy willfit the interests of the members of the currency union. The more synchronized the businesscycles of the members of the currency area, the lower the probability of asymmetric shocks,and the less dramatic the loss of monetary and exchange rate policy for the member countrysee Afonso and Furceri, 2008, for a theoretical model. Notwithstanding, since the work of Frankel and Rose 1998 the literature has remarked the potential for endogeneities of OCAcriteria, a set of interactions that are likely to improve the OCArating of a currency areasee De Grauwe and Mongelli, 2005, for an assessment of endogeneities of OCAcriteria.In particular, two kinds of endogeneities have been highlighted, between business cycle synchronization and trade integration and between business cycle synchronization and financialintegration, upon the basis that the removal of borders from monetary integration impliesa change in the structure of relationships among the members of the integration area. As aresult, a country that ex ante does not satify the requirements for being an optimal memberof a monetary union could accomplish those prerequisites ex post Frankel and Rose, 1998.The analysis of business cycle synchronization in EMU has focused basically on four issues.First of all, the assessment of synchronization in EMU12, detecting a period of conver1Huchet 2003 and Caporale and Soliman 2009 document different reactions to monetary shocks forcountries in the Eurozone. Recently, Jaroci nski 2010 has concluded that responses to monetary shocksbetween a group of EMU12 countries before euro adoption and a group of new EU members are qualitativelysimilar.2gence from the 90s Angeloni and Dedola, 1999, Massmann and Mitchell, 2003, Darvas and Sz apari, 2005, Afonso and Furceri, 2008 and some evidence of increasing heterogeneity during the recession of 20002002 Fidrmuc and Korhonen, 2004. Secondly, whether there isa coreperiphery difference, reaching some agreement on the existence of a core group ofcountries that shows higher synchronization. Thirdly, concerning the enlargement of the EMU, some new EU countries of the recent enlargements of 2004 and 2007 present similarrates of comovement to those displayed by some of the periphery EMU12 members Artis et al., 2004, Fidrmuc and Korhonen, 2004 and 2006, Darvas and Sz apari, 2005, Afonsoand Furceri, 2008. Finally, regarding the idiosyncrasy of the European synchronizationagainst a worldwide business cycle, there exists some evidence for the disappearance of the European differential during the 90s, diluting the European business cycle within a globalcycle Artis, 2003, P erez et al., 2007. Recently, CrespoCuaresma and Fern andezAmador2010 have developed a comprehensive methodology based on sigmaconvergence analysisthat offers answer to all these issues within the same framework. All their results are in linewith those of the literature here summarized.We analyze the dynamics of cyclical dispersion in Europe for the period 19602008, extracting the demand shocks and the demand components of Gross Domestic Product GDPfrom quarterly real GDP and Consumer Price Index CPI series for all members of EMU12 using the methodology for the estimation of demand and supply shocks developed by Blanchard and Quah 1989. As a measure of coherence, the time series of the crosscountrystandard deviation of both demand shocks and demand components of GDP demandGDP,identified as a proxy of cyclical developments are studied. Our methodology is based onthat developed by CrespoCuaresma and Fern andezAmador 2010, where the dynamics ofthe dispersion of cyclical components is analyzed as an indicator of business cycle coherence.Significant changes in this measure are assessed using Carree and Klomps 1997 sigmaconvergence test and Bai and Perron 1998 and 2003 procedure for detection of structuralbreaks in order to determine periods of convergencedivergence amongst the EMU12 members. The analysis is also carried out over a core group of EMU countries, the European Union EU members and a control OECD group with the aim of determining the idiosyncrasy of the Eurozone and implications of a potential EMU enlargement for the optimalityof the currency area. Therefore, this research can be seen both as a generalization and asa test for robustness of the results obtained by CrespoCuaresma and Fern andezAmador2010. Moreover, the analysis of dispersion of demand shocks and demand fluctuations of GDP, jointly with the analysis of responses of demandGDP to a demand shock allow usto determine to what extent the dynamics of cyclical comovements is due to coherence inshocks and what the effect of the propagation mechanism is. In this sense, our analysis offers some findings on whether the cyclical synchronization within EMU is the result of goodluck or good policy decisions that is, whether there exists synchronization of shocks, orwhether the propagation mechanisms of the European countries help in smoothing potentialasymmetries in shocks and thus produce some synchronization effect.Our results show that the Eurozone has converged to a stable lower level of dispersion fromthe end of the 80s in terms of coherence of demand shocks, and from the beginning of the 90s in demandGDP, supported by strong similarities among transmission mechanisms probably influenced by progressive integration following the implementation of the Maastricht 3convergence criteria, but also influenced by other factors, specially concerning trade. Thisconvergence pattern has diluted the differential of the core group. Only from 2005 onwards,this differential appears again. New EU members have also experienced a strong patternof convergence from 1998 to 2005, when a strong divergence trend appears. However, dueto the size of these economies, an enlargement of the currency union to 22 members wouldnot decrease the OCArating of the EMU. New EU members imply similar distorsions insynchronization for an enlarged EMU to those of the majority of the members of the EMU12. Finally, the Eurozone has been more synchronized relative to the OECD control groupsince the mid90s, and has presented some form of idiosyncrasy as opposed to a worldwidecomovement.The paper is structured as follows. In section 2 we present the estimation of demand shocksand the demand component of GDP. Section 3 provides a revision of the methodologyemployed for the analysis of cyclical synchronization developed by CrespoCuaresma and Fern andezAmador 2010. Section 4 shows the results for the analysis of both demandshocks and demandGDP synchronization, and summarizes the results of impulse responsefunctions. A comparative analysis of the EMU12 with some relevant groups is also carriedout in this section. In section 5, the cost of inclusion in the monetary union is put forwardand computed for EMU12 members, and for the members of an enlarged EMU. Section 6concludes.2 Extraction of demand shocks, supply shocks and business cycles The first step of our analysis deals with the extraction of structural demand and supplyshocks from macroeconomic data. The estimation of supply and demand shocks is carriedout by using a bivariate structural vector autoregressive SVAR model based on the methodology developed by Blanchard and Quah 1989. This method has become a standard toolin empirical macroeconomics to extract structural shocks, and can be easily implemented,since it is based on imposing simple longrun restrictions in the variancecovariance matrixof structural shocks in the framework of VARs. We perform our analysis using data on GDP and CPI, in the spirit of the work by Fidrmuc and Korhonen 2003. Our modelspecification is based on NewKeynesian assumptions see, for example, Mc Kinnon, 2000.It is assumed that the dynamics of the observed variables depend on unobserved supply anddemand shocks. Supply shocks have a permanent effect on output and inflation, whereasdemand shocks have permanent effects on inflation, but only transitory effects on output.A priori, positive supply shocks have a positive impact on output, and a negative one oninflation. A positive demand shock will produce an increase on inflation.The dynamics of the bivariate vector of observed variables of a country is postulated todepend on an infinite moving average representation of supply and demand shocks,yt B0t B1t 1 B2t 2   Bj Ljt1cid:88j04demand and supply shockscid:0dcid:1cid:48t stwhere yt is the vector of the observed variables GDP growth and inflation, t is the vector ofand Bj are 22 matrices with a characteristic elementj where k and l refer to the observed variable and the structural shock, respectively. Thesebkl Bj matrices summarize the transmission effects from the unobserved structural innovationsthe supply and demand shocks lagged j times to the observed variables, and L is the lagoperator. B0 is the contemporaneous effect of the structural shocks on the observed variables.Structural innovations are assumed to be uncorrelated and with variances normalized tounity, so that the variancecovariance matrix of shocks is assumed I. In the longrun,demand innovations are suppossed to have no effect on the dynamics of output growth. Thatj 0.

All the Bj coefficients can then be recoveredfrom the relationship between the residuals and the structural innovations t B0t, sinceall the elements of B0 are defined, given Bj Cj B0 for all j. Therefore, the conditionsfor identifying B0 must be given. Firstly, the elements of the main diagonal of B0, thevariances of the structural innovations are normalized to unity. Secondly, the structuralshocks are orthogonal, which imposes that B0Bcid:480 . Finally, the longrun effects ofthe structural unobserved shocks on the observed variables are determined by the matrixj0 Cj B0. Thus, the third condition for identification of B0 is the longrun restriction imposed by the fact that demand shocks have no longrun effect on output 0 0. Furthermore, the B0 matrix can be determined in a uniquecid:80j0 Bj cid:80cid:80j cid:80j b 11j0 c 11j0 b 11way.We perform our analysis upon GDP and CPI series for 36 countries of the EU 25 excluding Malta and Romania and a control group of OECD countries. Data are from Eurostat and OECD see Appendix A for details on samples and sources. Seasonal adjustment was necessary and carried out by using TRAMOSEATS G omez and Maravall, 1996 for GDP seriesof Bulgary, Switzerland, Estonia, Greece, Latvia and Slovenia, and for CPI series of Bulgary,Cyprus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Slovenia. GDP growth and inflation arecalculated as the first difference of quarterly log GDP and log CPI series, respectively.For every pair of series of each of the 36 countries we estimate the fullset SVAR usingcountryspecific laglengths chosen using the Schwarz 1978 information criterion with amaximum laglength of 18 quarters and requiring stationarity in the equation 3. The laglength obtained ranges from 3 to 5 lags, with most of the countries requiring 5 lags. Demandand supply shocks series are then retrieved, as well as the demand and supply components 5of GDP. Output fluctuations can be retrieved by means of the longrun restrictions estimated. In order to recover the output due to supply shocks, the level is obtained addinga constant drift and the intercept term to the series of output fluctuations. The GDP dueto demand is then defined as the difference between the output series and the supplysidecomponent. Figures 1 to 3 present the demand shocks for countries pertaining to the EMU12, the new EU countries, and the OECD control group including the three optingout EUcountries Denmark, Sweden, and United Kingdom. Figures 4 to 6 display, respectively,the demand components of output estimated for those three groups. In our analysis, thelatter are considered a proxy of the business cycle or the midterm developments in economicactivity, though as noted by Blanchard and Quah 1989 those are indeed different concepts.2As a measure of synchronization among the members of a currency area we will use the crossstandard deviation series of demand shocks and the demand components of GDP. This willallow us to identify to what extent the propagation mechanism induces synchronizationin the cyclical developments of countries considered in each group. We also make use ofresponses of demandGDP to a demand shock in order to determine similarities among thetransmission mechanism of the countries considered. In the following section we revise themethodology developed in CrespoCuaresma and Fern andezAmador 2010 for analyzingbusiness cycle comovements in a defined group.3 The assessment of synchronization: Methodology As an indicator of dispersion we use the weighted crosscountry standard deviation timeseries:cid:118cid:117cid:117cid:116 Ncid:88jt jt Ncid:88kt21 Ncid:88kt St jt,24j1k1j1of a group of N countries, where jt is alternatively the demand shock or the demandGDPof country j in period t, and where the weight jt for each country may be based on thesize of the country or assumed equal across economies.3 Therefore, time series techniquesfrom sigmaconvergence literature of economic growth can be applied in order to determinethe patterns or regimes of synchronization.The first step in order to analyze the synchronization of a selected group consists in assessingwhether the dynamics of the standard deviation series leads to significant changes in the levelof dispersion. Defining convergence as a reduction of the standard deviation of the variableof interest across economic units that form the group considered Lichtenberg, 1994, and Carree and Klomp, 1997, the Carree and Klomps T2 test statistic is computed in order totest for significant changes in the dispersion series. This statistic is given by T2,t, N 2.5 log1 0.25 S2t S2t 2 S2tt S2S2t,t ,52Detailed results of the estimated models can be obtained from the authors upon request.3See Appendix A for a description on the weighting schemes used.6where St is alternatively the crosscountry standard deviation of the demand shocks dt orthe demandGDP, and St,t is the covariance between dt or demandGDP inperiods t and t , respectively. Under the null hypothesis of no change in the standarddeviation between period t and period t , T2 is 21 distributed and can thus be usedto test for significant changes in dispersion. T2,t, was calculated using different potentialconvergencedivergence horizons ranging from two years 8 to eight years 32.t and d In a second step, the time series properties of the dispersion measure are studied in order toidentify systematic periods with different degrees of synchronization. The dispersion series isrepresented by an autoregressive process potentially subject to breaks in the intercept andorthe autoregressive parameter that determine potential different regimes of synchronization.The specification considered is the following,St 0,j 1,j St 1 . . . r,j StrITj 1 t Tj t,6Rcid:88j1where r is the number of lags considered in the specification, t is a white noise disturbance,R is the number of regimes considered and R 1 the number of breaks in the parametersof the process, T0 is the time index of the first observation and TR is the time index ofthe last observation. We consider three specifications. A partial structural model with thestructural change defined only in the intercept i,j i, i 1, . . . , r and j 1, . . . , R, apartial structural model with only the autoregressive parameters subject to structural change0,j 0, j 1, . . . , R, and a pure structural change model where all the parametersare allowed to change across regimes. The breaks are estimated in each case by choosing thevalues in the vector T1,  , TR1 that globally minimize the sum of squared residuals,that is, T1, . . . , TR1 arg min2t ,TRcid:88t1where the search for the breaks is done after imposing a minimum of 15% of the full sampleto be contained in each regime, in order to avoid spurious results caused by small subsamplesizes. The breaks were estimated in each case allowing for a maximum of 4 regimes R 4, 3breaks. The significance levels of the supF tests used for assessing the existence of breaksare obtained in each case by simulating the asymptotic critical values using the methodproposed by Bai and Perron 1998 and 2003.In the following section we analyze the synchronization of demand shocks and demandcomponents of GDP in the Eurozone and some related groups with the aim of answering thefollowing four questions: Whether there is a specific pattern of convergence in the euro areaduring the 90s, to what extent a core of countries performs better than the EMU12, whetherthe integration of the new EU members implies a reduction in the optimality of the Eurozone,and whether the possible appearance of a European comovement has been narrowed withina worldwide synchronization trend. In addition to this, we study if synchronization derivesfrom synchronization of shocks good luck or a good job of economic policy, or is theresult of something else than this and the propagation mechanism helps in demandGDPconvergence.74 Comovements in shocks and cyclical synchronization 4.1 EMU synchronization The dynamics of the weighted and unweighted standard deviation series of demand shocksand demand components of GDP are displayed in Figure 7, together with the trends of suchseries obtained by using the Hodrick and Prescott 1997 filter. From the comparison ofunweighted and weighted measures, we can conclude that small countries seem to induceheterogeneity in comovements of shocks in the beginning of the sample until the late 70sand from the mid 90s onwards. When looking at the demandGDP developments, smallcountries tend to bring about divergence in the Eurozone during the whole sample period.We focus on weighted measures, hereafter. Concerning dispersion of shocks, a pattern ofconvergence is detected in the beginning of the sample till 1972, when a short period of divergence starts until the mid70s. A new pattern of convergence in demand shocks appearsduring the late 70s until the late 80s. From the last years of the 80s onwards, the level ofsynchronization of demand shocks remains relatively stable around a lower level, and onlytwo sharp peaks of divergence emerge during the recession of 20002002 and the recessionaryperiod in the end of the sample.With regard to the dispersion of demandGDP, the sample starts with a strong convergenceperiod in the beginning of the 60s. This turns into a very short period of divergence in theend of the 60s, before experiencing a new reversal that culminates in the mid 70s. After aperiod of higher cyclical dispersion from the middle of the 70s to the beginning of the 80s,a persistent convergence trend takes place, especially in the second half of the 80s, which isreversed in the beginning of the 90s, during the recessionary period of the first years of thatdecade. From 1993 on, a very stable period of more synchronization starts which is onlyreversed in the last year of the sample, since 20082.In order to test for the significance of changes in the standard deviation of shocks anddemandGDP in EMU12, we compute the Carree and Klomps 1997 test described in theprevious section. Figure 8 displays the changes in the standard deviation of demand shocksand demandGDP in EMU12 that appear significant at the 5% significance level for thehorizons corresponding to two, four, six and eight years. The variable which is plotted in Figure 8 is defined asct St St IT2,t, 270.951 is the 95th percentile ofwhere is alternatively equal to 8, 16, 24 and 32 quarters, 2the 21 distribution and I is the indicator function, taking value one if the argument istrue and zero otherwise.40.951,Figure 8 indicates that the mediumrun dynamics shown in Figure 7 actually lead to significant changes in the dispersion of both demand shocks and demandGDP in EMU12 for theperiod under study. With respect to the dispersion in demand shocks, the most importantfact is the period of strong convergence coming from the late 70s to the end of the 80s.4Results are robust if a 1% significance level is used. Computations are available from the authors uponrequest.8From 1995 on, the very stable dynamics of synchronization depicts few significant patterns,all of them of small magnitude. The signs of divergence coinciding with the recession ofthe 20002002 and the recession of the end of the sample are remarkable. Concerning thedispersion of demandGDP, we should note the same convergence pattern starting in thebeginning of the 80s until the beginning of the 90s. Since then 19941995, a very stableperiod appears also with hardly significant patterns of change, with only some small tracesof divergence in the recessionary periods of 20002002 and in the end of the sample.We also implement BaiPerrons 1998 and 2003 test for the analysis of structural changeSC in order to identify different regimes in the dynamics of dispersion of shocks and demand components of GDP. Table 2 presents the Augmented DickeyFuller ADF, Dickeyand Fuller, 1979 and KPSS Kwiatkowsky et al., 1992 tests for the EMU12 group, a OECD group considering all the countries that are not part of the European integrationprocess and the three optout clause members Denmark, United Kingdom and Sweden,and a group including both groups Global 1. Unit root tests offer contradicting results.ADF tests Dickey and Fuller, 1979 reject the null of a unit root for dipersion series ofdemand shocks and demandGDP in EMU, whereas the KPSS Kwiatkowsky et al., 1992test tends to reject stationarity.Tables 3 and 4 summarize the results for demand shocks and demandGDP dispersion seriesfor EMU12, OECD and Global 1, respectively. Figure 9 displays the weighted standarddeviation series and the unconditional expectations for each regime. Regarding the EMU12group, the dispersion series of demand shocks is represented by means of an autoregressiveprocess of order 2 AR2, and the standard deviation of demandGDP by an AR1 specification. This seems to be sufficient to remove autocorrelation in the residuals. Therefore,we consider the data generating process represented in equation 6 potentially subject tobreaks in the intercept, in the autoregressive parameters partialSC models, or in the intercept and autoregressive coefficients pureSC model.5Models with one break are sufficient to capture the dynamics of the dispersion series. Inthose cases where a twobreaks model can be estimated, wide confidence intervals in thesecond break make more sensible to use models with one break. Regarding the synchronization of demand shocks see Table 3, the model with one structural change in the interceptestimated in 19861 is the prefered one in terms of Schwarz 1978 information criterionnot shown in Table 3. This model determines a decrease in the unconditional expectationof the dispersion series and in its volatility. With respect to the dispersion series in thedemand fluctuations of GDP see Table 4, the model with a structural break in the intercept in 19932 seems to be the prefered one, too, because the pureSC model shows wideconfidence intervals. The model also determines a decrease in the unconditional expectationof dispersion and in the volatility of the dispersion series.Besides the analysis of dipersion of shocks and demandGDP, it is useful to consider theresponses of GDPgrowth to a positive demand shock of 1% given the estimated parameters 5We report the selected models. Information about all the models considered is available from the authorsupon request.9of the SVAR model not shown because of space limitations.6 We summarize such information. In general, we can extract some common features. All the countries show somehow apositive response to the demand shocks that tends to dissappear, becoming close to zero after 810 quarters. Only Austria, Netherlands and Belgium show negative responses in someperiods in the beginning of the responsehorizon. Together with the results offered above,synchronization of demand shocks, strengthened during the late 80s, have been supportedby the transmission mechanism. The role of the latter may have been reinforced during theprocess of integration, supporting convergence in demand GDP fluctuations.Therefore, the Eurozone has converged to a stable lower level of dispersion from the endof the 80s in terms of demand shocks, and from the beginning of the 90s in demandGDPas can be inferred by Figure 9, supported by strong similarities among propagation mechanisms probably influenced by progressive integration following the implementation of the Maastricht convergence criteria during the Stage Two of EMU, but also influenced by otherfactors related to trade. This result is in line with previous research of Angeloni and Dedola1999, Massmann and Mitchell 2003, Darvas and Sz apari 2005, Afonso and Furceri2008, or CrespoCuaresma and Fern andezAmador 2010, for example. Moreover, according to Mayes and Vir en 2009, the Maastricht Treaty and the transition period of the Stage Two seem to be linked to a structural change in the midterm fluctuations in the EMUthat increased the optimality of the Eurozone, though such convergence may start earlierwith the convergence in demand shocks initiating in the mid 80s.4.2 Comparative analysis The literature on business cycle synchronization in Europe has pointed out some other questions with the aim of analyzing the singularity of the EMU comovement, and determiningthe optimality of the currency area. In this regard, three main issues have been highlighted.The first one concerns the debate between core and periphery countries and the potentialdifferential of a core group of EMU countries Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg and Netherlands showing higher cyclical synchronization than EMU12. The second issue isconnected with the coherence of cyclical developments of the new EU members with respectto EMU12 and the impact of a hypothetical enlargement of the monetary union includingall the members from the recent enlargements of 2004 and 2007. The third issue is aboutthe idiosyncrasy of the European synchronization relative to a worldwide comovent.Figures 10 and 11 present the dispersion series of demand shocks and demandGDP together with their HodrickPrescott 1997 trends for some relevant groups such as the coregroup, the group formed by the new EU members of the enlargements of 2004 and 2007, anenlarged EMU EMU22 and the EU25 see Figure 10, and the OECD control group, agroup including the OECD and EMU12 groups Global 1 and a group including all the 36countries considered Global 2, see Figure 11. With regard to the core group see Figure 10, the level and dynamics of dispersion in demand shocks are very close to the EMU12.From 1965 to 1980, the core group has clearly shown more synchronization in shocks. This issomehow reversed from the first years of the 90s on, however, when the core group presentsslighty higher dispersion than EMU12. Concerning the dispersion of demandGDP, the core 6Computed impulse response functions are available from the authors upon request.10group is more synchronized than EMU12 from the beginning of the sample until the late 80sprobably, due to higher integration in the economic structures and more similar economicpolicies in the core during this period. Afterwards, this differential in comovement seemsto dissappear specially from the late 80s until 1997. Only in the end of the sample from 2005 on the core group clearly becomes more synchronized once again. With respect to thegroup of new members from recent enlargements, for both demand shocks and demandGDPdispersion series a strong trend of convergence is detected from 1998 to 2005, when it is reversed and a period of increasing divergence starts. The level of dispersion is higher thanthe one corresponding to the EMU12 either for demand shocks or demandGDP dispersionseries. This convergence trend is consistent with evidence of real and nominal convergenceof macroeconomic fundamentals provided by Kocenda 2001, and Kutan and Yigit 2004for the late 90s. However, we find how a strong divergence trend appears in this group from 2005 on.Considering a hypothetical enlarged EMU EMU22, differences in dispersion are not relevant given the small weight of the new members relative to the EMU12 countries. Thedispersion of shocks shows similar dynamics and levels in both groups. Turning to demandGDP dispersion, only in 20022003 and 20062008 significant gaps can be observed betweenthe EMU22 and EMU12, when the EMU12 experiences more synchronization. This findingreflects the convergence trend of the new EU countries towards the EMU12 documentedhere and by Artis et al.2004, Fidrmuc and Korhonen 2004 and 2006, Darvas and Sz apari 2005, Kutan and Yigit 2005, Afonso and Furceri 2008, or CrespoCuaresmaand Fern andezAmador 2010, for example. The appraisal of the EU25 points out similarconclusions as that of the EMU22, with attenuated differences, however. Moreover, the EU25 reveals a slightly more synchronized behavior during the period 20042006.Turning to Figure 11 where the results for the OECD are presented, this group has shownmore synchronization in demand shocks than EMU12 until the mid 80s, when the EMU12becomes more synchronized. With respect to the demandGDP dispersion series, the EMU12 has been more synchronized from the late 70s, and only approaches the OECD levelsduring the period spanning the late 80s until the end of the recession of 19911993, duringthe 19992000 period and in 20084. Consequently, considering the group formed by the EMU12 and OECD Global 1, the demand shocks dispersion series reveals also the changefrom more to less synchronization relative to EMU12. The demandGDP dispersion seriesreveals that the EMU12 has achieved more synchronization, but for the periods 19881994,19992000 and in 20084. The global group including all the 36 countries Global 2 leads tosimilar conclusions.Structural change analysis was also applied upon the OECD and Global 1 dispersion seriessee Tables 3 and 4 and Figure 9. As in the case of EMU12, ADF tests Dickey and Fuller,1979 reject the null of a unit root for series of dipersion of demand shocks and demandGDPin EMU, whereas the KPSS test Kwiatkowsky et al., 1992 tends to reject stationarity see Table 2. We can summarize the dynamics of the dispersion series of shocks and demandGDP by means of AR1 processes for both OECD and Global 1 groups. With respect to OECD shocks dispersion see Table 3, the prefered model is that with a structural breakin the autoregressive coefficient. The OECD experiences a structural change around 1983111towards a lower average. The dynamics of dispersion is less volatile in the second regime,too. However, this change seems to be less dramatic than in the case of Eurozone. Moreover, in the first regime the OECD seems to be more synchronized than EMU12, thoughin the second regime the latter shows more synchronization than the former. Finally, thebreak experienced in shocks dispersion series has not lead to a change in the demandGDPstandard deviation see Table 4.Concerning the Global 1 group, the specification with a break in the intercept estimated in 19831 seems to perform slightly better in the case of the synchronization of demand shockssee Table 3. Every specification implies a decrease in the expectation and volatility of thedispersion series after the break. In the case of the dispersion series of demandGDP, thespecification with a break in the intercept estimated in 19842 performs better and reflectsthe decrease in both expectation and volatility of the data generating process see Table 4. Nevertheless, the comparison between the figures of the EMU12 and the Global 1 groupreflect the more synchronized behavior of the Eurozone from the mid90s.In addition to this, impulse response functions not shown show less similarity in the transmission of demand shocks among the new EU members and among the OECD group.Overall, the EMU12 seems to have converged to a stable lower level of dispersion fromthe end of the 80s in demand shocks, and from the beginning of the 90s in demandGDP,supported by strong similitudes among transmission mechanisms probably influenced byprogressive integration, following the implementation of the Maastricht convergence criteria,but also influenced by other factors, specially trade integration. This convergence patternhas diluted the differential of the core group. Only from 2005 onwards, this differentialreturns. The new EU members have also experienced a strong pattern of convergence from 1998 to 2005, when a strong divergence trend appears. However, due to the size of theseeconomies, an enlargement of the currency union to 22 members would not decrease the OCArating of the EMU. Finally, the Eurozone presents higher levels of synchronizationrelative the OECD control group since the mid90s, and has presented some Europeanidiosyncrasy as opposed to a worldwide comovement.5 The cost of inclusion of a member We can complement the previous analysis by means of the computation of the netbenefitof being part of a currency union for its members in terms of cyclical synchronization. Thecost of inclusion of a country j in the group is defined as Stj Stcoit,j St,8where Stj is the weighted crosscountry standard deviation series of the group excluding country j and St is the weighted crosscountry standard deviation of the group including country j at time t. The cost of inclusion is therefore defined as a rate of changein dispersion, taking negative values when the standard deviation of the group increases asthe country is included that is, when the country induces divergence in the group, and 12positive values when the inclusion of the country induces a decrease in the dispersion thatis, when it induces convergence. The cost of inclusion of a country is a representation ofthe impact that each country has in the degree of synchronization of a currency union ata given period in time. Figures 1217 show the cost of inclusion of each member for the EMU12 and the hypothetical enlarged EMU considered in the section above regarding thedemand shocks and demandGDP.Figures 12 and 13 present the cost of inclusion of each country belonging to EMU12 for demand shocks and demandGDP, respectively. Regarding those computed in terms of demandshocks, it should be noted the role of Austria, Germany, France, Finland and Luxembourgas clear sources of convergence during almost the whole sample, as well as of Spain, Greece,Italy and Netherlands, since 1995. With respect to the cost of inclusion computed fordemandGDP measures, the same group of countries Austria, Germany, France, Finland,Luxembourg inducing convergence is detected. In contrast, Spain shows a more ambiguousbehavior.7 It should be noted that the generally positive ratios of Germany and Franceare of sizeable magnitude for both demand shocks and demandGDP measures, what couldbe interpreted as Germany and France as the anchors of EMU. However, this is also clearlyrelated to the substantial weight of both countries in the Eurozone and it is not appreciatedwhen considering unweighted standard deviations not shown.8 Finally, we should highlight the costs resulting from Germany during the years following the reunification, speciallyregarding demandGDP measures.Figures 1415 display the cost of inclusion of the members of an enlarged European currencyunion, for demand shocks and demandGDP, respectively. The most important conclusionfrom these graphs is that new EU members do not imply significant costs as members ofan enlarged Eurozone. Nevertheless, these results could be due to the small weight of theseeconomies in the euro area. Therefore, we also include the results of the cost of inclusionscomputed with unweighted standard deviations see Figures 16 and 17. Although theimpact of the new EU members is somehow more ambiguous, with more periods of cost,their behavior is not different to the one observed in the majority of the members of the EMU12.6 Conclusions We offer here five main findings with the aim of answering the most important issues raisedin the empirical literature of cyclical synchronization in Europe. First of all, we show thatthe Eurozone has converged to a stable lower level of dispersion in demand shocks from theend of the 80s, and from the beginning of the 90s in demandGDP, supported by strongsimilarities among propagation mechanisms probably influenced by progressive integrationfollowing the implementation of the Maastricht convergence criteria during Stage Two of EMU, but also influenced by other factors as trade integration.In line with Mayes and Vir en 2009, the Maastricht Treaty and the transition period of the Stage Two seem to 7Some of the results in the end of the sample should be taken with caution. This is the case for exampleof Ireland where the model estimated does not capture the decrease associated with such recessionary periodin the demandGDP.8Computations are available from the authors upon request.13be linked to a structural change in the midterm fluctuations in the EMU that increasedthe optimality of the Eurozone, though such trend may start earlier, with the convergencein demand shocks coming from the mid 80s. Second, this convergence pattern has dilutedthe differential of the core group. Only from 2005 onwards, this differential returns. Third,the new EU members have also experienced a strong pattern of convergence from 1998 to 2005. Fourth, due to the size of these economies, an enlargement of the currency union to 22members would not decrease the OCArating of the EMU in terms of cyclical synchronization, and does not imply costs for the Eurozone. In any case, the new EU members showsimilar costs of inclusion to those of the majority of the members of the EMU12. Finally,the Eurozone appears more synchronized relative to the OECD control group in terms ofdemand shocks since the mid 80s and from the mid90s in terms of demandGDP, and haspresented some European idiosyncrasy as opposed to a dilution in a worldwide comovement.Our result concerning the lack of important effect of the enlargement of the EMU uponthe OCArating is of special relevance, but some caveats could be highlighted regarding theestimations for the new EU economies and the use of only one OCA criterion for recomendations about euro adoption by these countries. Convergence of the new EU members towards EMU is well documented by the empirical literature. However, results concerning the new EU members undergo the problem of short sample size, and may reflect excepcional samplefeatures coming from the transition from planned to market economies that these countriesexperienced during the decade of the 90s see Campos and Coricelli, 2002, for a descriptionof these features and Svejnar, 2002, and Foster and Stehrer, 2007, for a characterization ofthe transition periods and where political factors were of remarkable importance Roland,2002. In addition to this, the preservation of the OCArating in output fluctuations afterthe enlargement reported here refers to the whole currency area. The net balance of joininga currency union is a wider concept.It depends on the character and symmetry of theshocks, but also on the transmission mechanisms of such shocks and the monetary policy inthe countries forming the currency union. In this sense, in order to assess the convenienceof euro adoption by the new EU members, other OCA prerequisites such as nominal convergence, trade and financial integration, fiscal coordination and labour market flexibilityshould be considered. Evidence reported by different authors using other criteria tends tosupport the enlargement of the EMU. In fact, there is some evidence of nominal convergence pointed out by Kutan and Yigit 2005 and Lein et al. 2008, for example. Lein etal. 2008 also highlight the effect of real convergence on price level catchup through twomain channels: Productivity growth in the new EU members, which has a positive impactin nominal convergence through BalassaSamuelson effects, and trade intensification, witha negative impact through markups reduction in the framework of competitiveness gains.Economic integration, financial integration and fiscal coordination deserve careful consideration as potential factors affecting the optimality of the adoption of the euro by the new EU members, because of their endogenous relationship with synchronization of output fluctuations. Economic and financial integration are goals of the EU, and the monetary unionshould help reaching these goals. Rose 2000 opened a door for supporting the idea ofa positive effect of EMU on trade, though his research is subject to some drawbacks see Baldwin, 2006. Petroulas 2007 finds a positive impact of EMU on inward foreign directinvestment FDI flows. Recently, Brouwer et al. 2008 make use of gravity models and 14present support concerning the existence of a complementary relationship between tradeand FDI, a positive effect of the EU on trade and FDI, and a positive effect of EMU on FDI and a nonnegative effect on trade. These results lead these authors to conclude thatjoining the Eurozone would increase the FDI stock countries receive as well as trade flows,being part of the trade increase a result from higher FDI stocks. Financial integrationpresents many facets. From an aggregate perspective, Blanchard and Giavazzi 2002 and Lane 2006b suggest that monetary integration has increased financial integration, and Lane 2006a finds evidence of a Eurozone bias in international bond portfolio movements,which implies that more crossborder asset trade tends to take place between members ofthe euro area than among other pairings. In particular, Spiegel 2009 shows that the monetary integration has an effect on bilateral bank lending through a pairwise effect comingfrom joint membership in a monetary union by two members what increases the quality ofintermediation between borrowers and creditors when both are in the same currency union.Stock market comovements seem to be enhanced by monetary integration Kim et al., 2005,or W alti, 2010, for example. Moreover, Abad et al. 2010 have shown that debt marketsare mainly driven by domestic factors in EU and US, and that EMU debt markets, thoughonly partially integrated with the Eurozone represented by the German government bondsmarket, are more influenced by euro risk factors than by global risk factors as opposed tothose of nonEMU countries, which tend to be more influenced by worldwide risk factors.With respect to the new EU countries, Masten et al. 2008 find evidence that joining the EMU implies the development of domestic financial markets and financial integration forthe new EU members, with a positive effect on economic growth.One of the major concerns when joining a currency union is the loss of fiscal sovereignty.The theoretical literature has defined two main ways of policy coordination. Von Hagenand Mundschenk 2001 differentiate between narrow coordination, focused on monitoringnational policies and practises challenging price stability, leaving relative freedom to policy goals and instruments, and broad coordination where explicit frameworks concerningcommon policy goals and strategies are developed in an agreement. Ferr e 2008 showsin a game theoretical model that broad coordination in fiscal policy would be prefered tonarrow coordination. In this broad coordination framework, the incentive to deviate fromthe agreement comes from the presence of supply shocks and different evolutions in competitiveness, whereas there is no incentive to deviate from the agreement under differentialdemand shocks, the most important from the point of view of stabilization policies. In addition, Afonso and Furceri 2008 found empirical evidence that the shocksmoothing roleof fiscal policy is enhanced in an enlarged EMU. Finally, other major political issue of theenlargement of the EMU is labour market flexibility. Boeri and Garibaldi 2006 illustratethat the degree of labour flexibility of the new EU members is in many dimensions largerthan in the Eurozone. They also show that jobless economic growth in these countries inthe last years is related to productivityenhancing job destruction after the prolonged labourhoarding during the transition periods until 1996. Thereby, taking into consideration ourresults and the main findings of the related literature, it is possible to be optimistic regardingthe enlargement of the EMU from both the perspective of the performance of the commonmonetary policy and the new EMU members side.15References1 ABAD, P., CHULI A, H. and M.

For each country, weights were calculated relativeto the group considered. Two schemes of weights were used. The first one, a timevaryingscheme in which for each year the weight was calculated and therefore a series of annualweights was used when computing the indicators. The second one is a scheme based onthe mean weight for the whole sample period. This last weighting scheme was used whencalculating the standard deviation series in the Carree and Klomp 1997 test. Our resultsare robust to the use of both weighting patterns.19Figure 1: Demand shocks: EMU countries 20432101234196519701975198019851990199520002005Austria432101234196519701975198019851990199520002005Belgium420246196519701975198019851990199520002005Germany543210123196519701975198019851990199520002005Spain43210123196519701975198019851990199520002005Finland432101234196519701975198019851990199520002005France6420246196519701975198019851990199520002005Greece432101234196519701975198019851990199520002005Ireland432101234196519701975198019851990199520002005Italy43210123196519701975198019851990199520002005Luxembourg5432101234196519701975198019851990199520002005Netherlands5432101234196519701975198019851990199520002005PortugalFigure 2: Demand shocks: Enlargement countries 2132101299000102030405060708Bulgary3210129899000102030405060708Cyprus5432101219941996199820002002200420062008Czech Republic3210123979899000102030405060708Estonia4321012319941996199820002002200420062008Hungary32101239899000102030405060708Latvia2.52.01.51.00.50.00.51.01.52.0979899000102030405060708Lithuani32101234199219941996199820002002200420062008Poland321012979899000102030405060708Slovenia43210129596979899000102030405060708s Lovak RepublicFigure 3: Demand shocks: OECD countries 225432101234196519701975198019851990199520002005Australia43210123196519701975198019851990199520002005Canada32101234519701975198019851990199520002005Switzerland4321012319701975198019851990199520002005Denmark543210123196519701975198019851990199520002005United Kingdom32101234196519701975198019851990199520002005Iceland8642024196519701975198019851990199520002005Japan54321012341975198019851990199520002005Rep.

University of Innsbruck Working Papers in Economics and Statistics 201025 Jesus CrespoCuaresma and Octavio FernandezAmador Business cycle convergence in EMU: A second look at the second moment Abstract We analyse the dynamics of the standard deviation of demand shocks and of the demand component of GDP across countries in the European Monetary Union EMU. This analysis allows us to evaluate the patterns of cyclical comovement in EMU and put them in contrast to the cyclical performance of the new members of the EU and other OECD countries. We use the methodology put forward in CrespoCuaresma and FernandezAmador 2010, which makes use of sigmaconvergence methods to identify synchronization patterns in business cycles. The Eurozone has converged to a stable lower level of dispersion across business cycles during the end of the 80s and the beginning of the 90s. The new EU members have also experienced a strong pattern of convergence from 1998 to 2005, when a strong divergence trend appears. An enlargement of the EMU to 22 members would not decrease its optimality as a currency area. There is evidence for some European idiosyncrasy as opposed to a worldwide comovement.
