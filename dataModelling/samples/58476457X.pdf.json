In ALM,stochastic interest rate models are used to price embedded options in banking book products. An important example of such an embedded option is theprepayment option on fixed rate mortgages. A prepayment option closelyresembles a Bermudan swaption, apart from the fact that the customersexercise strategy is more complex in the case of mortgages. The maturityof the swap underlying the Bermudan has been chosen at 10 years becauseit is the most common choice of period for fixing mortgage rates in somecountries, for example, the Netherlands. Prepayment options are hedged tostabilize value changes.1 In this paper, we compare the performance of four 1factor models, viz., HullWhite HW, BlackKarasinski BK, Swap Market Model SMM and Libor Market Model LMM, in hedging an 11year Bermudan swaption i.e., 1year option on 10year swap on an annual basisfrom February 2006 to September 2007 in both Euro and USD markets.Unlike the case of the shortterm pricing problem, the onefactor model isoften preferred for low frequency ALM purpose because of its simplicity. Forlong horizon hedging, the multifactor model could produce more noise as itrequires more parameter input. For the same reason, we do not consider thesmile effect in this ALM study. Pricing performance measures a modelscapability of capturing the current term structure and market prices of interest rate sensitive instruments. Pricing performance can always be improved,in an almost sure sense, by adding more explanatory variables and complexities to the dynamics. However, pricing performance alone cannot reflect 1In a trading environment, value changes and PL are the same things. However, in ALM, a different accounting policy is used accrual accounting so that value changes donot immediately run through the PL.3the models ability to capture the true term structure dynamics as it evolvesthrough time. To assess the appropriateness of model dynamics, one has tostudy the models outofsample forecasting and hedging performance.The last few decades have seen the development of a great variety of interest rate models for estimating prices and risk sensitivities of interest ratederivatives. These models can be broadly divided into short rate, forwardrate, and market models. The class of shortrate models, among others,includes Vasicek 1977 52, Hull and White 1990 26, and Black and Karasinski 1991 6. A generalized framework for arbitragefree forwardrate modeling originates from the work of Heath, Jarrow and Morton HJM,1992 24. Market models are a class of models within the HJM frameworkthat model the evolution of rates that are directly observable in the market. Brace, Gatarek and Musiela 1997 5 and Miltersen, Sandmann and Sondermann 1997 45 and Jamshidian 1997 34 are among the first tointroduce the arbitrage free process for forward Libor rates which lead tothe Libor Market Model under the HJM framework. The SMM was firstproposed by Jamshidian 1997 34 who also introduces the concept of thecoterminal swap market model.All these models have their own strengths and weaknesses. Shortratemodels are tractable, easy to understand and implement, but do not providecomplete freedom in choosing the volatility structure. The HJM frameworkis popular due to its flexibility in terms of the number of factors that canbe used and it permits different volatility structures for forward rates of different maturities. The key problem associated with the HJM is that instantaneous forward rates are not directly observable in the market and hencemodels under this framework are difficult to calibrate. Market models, suchas LMM and SMM, overcome these limitations but are more complex andcomputationally expensive when compared with the short rate models. Thequestion is whether one should use simple models like Gaussian HW modelor the lognormal BK model, or a more complicated model like SMM and LMM. In this paper, our focus is on the difference between the four interestrate models for longer term asset liability management in two interest rateregimes i.e., Euro and USD. The choice of HW and BK is simple: at the 4time of writing, they are the most important and popular short rate modelsused by the industry; the choice of Swap Market Model and Libor Market Model is also simple because they are new or more recent and are widelyused among practitioners.This study extends the current interest rate empirical literature by comparing a wide range of models, from spot and forward to swap rate models;by focusing on the hedging performance on the more complicated Bermudanswaptions instead of caplets, floorlets or European swaptions; by takinga broader ALM perspective and by comparing model performance acrosscurrencies. At the time of writing, hedging of Bermudan swaptions has onlybeen done by two papers with real financial data: Longstaff, Schwartz and SantaClara 2001a 43 and Andersen and Andreason 2002 2. Pieterszand Pelser 2001 46 present a new way to calculate vega for hedging Bermudan swaption but they do not perform any empirical tests. In addition, none of them compare the short rate models with market modelsand from an ALM perspective.Specifically, the objective here is to select an interest rate term structuremodel that produces the best hedging performance of a portfolio of 11year Bermudan swaption and hedging instruments over a 1year horizon. Thehedging profit and loss is calculated as the difference between the values ofthe hedged portfolio on initialization date and on the date 1 year later whenit was unwound. This exercise is repeated every month over the data sampleperiod spanning from February 2005 to September 2006. The data are from Datastream and ABN AMRO bank.Despite the vastly different implementation and calibration procedures,and the different dynamics of the key rates, the pricing and hedging resultsof the four term structure models tested are not markedly different. Forthe Euro market, the performance difference is hardly noticeable.In the USD market, the short rate models are marginally better than the twomarket models. Since parameter estimates are more stable for the HWmodel and the fact that Gaussian in contrast to lognormal facilitates theuse of analytical results, we would therefore conclude by recommending the HW model, but stress the fact that the differences among the four models 5are not great.This remaining of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discussesthe previous studies and section 3 briefly describes the models we use andthe research design. Data is described in Section 4. Section 5 deals withcalibration procedures of all models and calibration instruments, as well ascalibration algorithm.In Section 6, Bermudan swaption prices from thefour models are compared. Hedging performance and PL are reported in Section 7 and, finally, we conclude in Section 8.2 Previous Studies Significant effort has been placed on developing pricing models for interestrate claims. However, the empirical evaluation of these models, especiallyin the swaption market, has lagged behind the theoretical advances madein this area. Much of the literature on multifactor term structure modelshas focused on explaining bond yield and swap rates, as outlined in Daiand Singleton 2003 15. Therefore, despite the importance of caps andswaptions, there is still wide divergence of opinion on how to best value theseclaims. It is widely believed that since the term structure of interest ratesis driven by multiple factors, interest rate claims should be valued usingmultifactor models.Amin and Morton 1994 4 implement and test six HJM interest ratemodels using an implied volatility technique with Eurodollar futures and Eurodollar futures options data. They find that twoparameter models tend tofit prices better, but their parameter estimates are less stable and they earnless from the perceived mispricings. Although the oneparameter models fitslightly less well, their implied parameter values are more stable over timeand they are able to earn significantly larger and more consistent abnormalprofits from the mispricings they detect. Using caplet data, where maturities ranged from 1 year to 10 years, Ritchken and Chuang 1999 49 showthat generalized Vasicek model captures the hump in the volatility of forward rates, leads to significant improvements on pricing. The interest rateclaims are priced in the HeathJarrowMorton paradigm and the structure of 6volatilities is captured without using time varying parameters. As a result,the volatility structure is stationary. Gupta and Subrahmanyam 2005 21examine many one and twofactor models HW, HJM and LMM for pricingand hedging interest rate caps and floors. Unlike Amin and Morton, theyconclude that a onefactor lognormal forward rate model outperforms othercompeting onefactor models in pricing accuracy, with two factor modelsimproving pricing performance only marginally. However, for hedging, theyfind a significant advantage in moving from one to twofactor models. Thecaplets four maturities: 2, 3, 4, and 5year in their paper are hedged using Eurodollar futures contracts up to a maturity of 10 years, in incrementsof 3 months. The hedging rebalancing interval is 5day and 20day. Buhler,Uhrig, Walter and Weber 1999 11 test different one and twofactor models four forward rate models and three spot rate models in the Germanfixedincome warrants market. They found that the onefactor forward ratemodel with linear proportional volatility and the two spotrate models withtwo factors outperform the other models. Unlike Gupta and Subrahmanyam2005 21, they find no advantage in moving beyond a onefactor model.Using 3 years of interest rate caps price data accross strikes, Jarrow, Li, and Zhao 2007 37 show that even a threefactor model with stochastic volatility and jumps cannot completely capture the smileskew patterns observedin this market.In contrast to the capfloor market, few empirical studies have beenconducted on swaptions. Longstaff, SantaClara, Schwartz LSS, 2001a 43use a string model to test the relative valuation of caps and swaptions usingatthemoney cap and swaptions data, and find support for using model withat least four factors for pricing swaptions. They use 34 swaptions data wherethe final maturity dates of the underlying swap are less than or equal to 10years and the interest rate cap data consists of weekly midmarket impliedvolatility for 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 10 years. Their criterion for evaluatingmodels is based on the sum of squared percentage pricing errors. In otherwords, their criterion is based on pricing accuracy, not on hedging precision.Peterson, Stapleton and Subrahmanyam 2003 48 develop an extension ofthe lognormal model of Black and Karasinski 1991 6 to multiple factors 7and provide evidence that the addition of a third factor is helpful in pricingswaptions.Not all studies, however, indicate that multiple factors are necessaryfor improving pricing performance for swaptions. For example, Driessen,Klaassen, and Melenberg 2003 hereafter DKM 16 investigate the performance of several Gaussian models, where volatility structures are deterministic functions of their maturities. They show that the outofsamplepricing performance of swaption pricing models does not necessarily improveas the number of factors increases. Indeed, one of their onefactor modelsprices swaptions no worse than their multifactor models and to the same degree of accuracy as LSSs multifactor model. Jagannathan, Kaplin and Sun2003 35 investigate the pricing of swaptions using multifactor Cox, Ingersoll and Ross models. Their preliminary conclusions suggest that increasingthe number of factors does not necessarily improve pricing performance. Indeed, adding factors makes the pricing of short term contracts worse. Fan,Gupta and Ritchken 2007 18 compare the pricing performance of severalsingle and multifactor models with different volatility structures and identify those models that eliminate most of the pricing biases in the swaptionmarket.In this regard, their paper is closely related to DKM and LSS.They find that for pricing swaptions, the benefit of increasing the numberof factors beyond one is minor. Their results also show that incorporatinglevel dependence in the volatility structure is extremely important for awayfromthemoney caps, and that proportional dependent structures are betterthan both square root and level independent structures. For atthemoneyswaptions, the level dependence issue is minor.Very few studies have compared the abilities of different models for hedging swaptions. LSS briefly consider hedging, in the context of their fourfactor model, relative to the Black model. The most related studies onswaptions hedging are by DKM 2003 16 and Fan, Gupta and Ritchken2003 17. DKM uses the caps with maturities ranging from 1 to 10 years.For the swaptions, the option maturities range from one month to five yearswhile the swaps maturities range from 5 to 10 years. The hedging interval istwo weeks, i.e., the value of the hedge portfolio is calculated two weeks after 8the hedge portfolio is constructed. DKM use the HJM model to demonstratethat if the number of hedge instruments zero coupon bonds with differentmaturities is equal to the number of factors, multifactor models outperformonefactor models in hedging caps and swaptions. However, they claim thatby using a large set of hedge instruments, their onefactor models perform aswell as multifactor models. This last finding is the opposite of what Guptaand Subrahmanyam 2005 21 find in the cap market. In the context of Unspanned Stochastic Volatility USV, Fan, Gupta, and Ritchken 200317 show that even swaption straddles can be well hedged using Libor bondsalone if at least a three factor model is used. HJM is used as the basic modelin the hedging test. The volatilities of U.S. dollar swaptions with expirationdates of six months and one, two, three, four, and five years, with underlyingswap maturities of two, three, four, and five years. Different Libor discountbonds are used as the factor hedging instruments. The hedge position ismaintained unchanged for one week, and the hedged and unhedged residualsare obtained and stored. They then repeat this analysis for holding periodsof two, three, and four weeks. Fan, Gupta and Ritchken 2007 18 find thatmultifactor models are essential for reducing the risk in hedged positions.They also demonstrate that allowing additional hedging instruments in aone and two factor model does not improve the results. Their main conclusion is that while accurate swaption prices can be obtained from a onefactormodel, one and even twofactor models cannot hedge swaptions well, andthe benefits of multifactor models are significant. The data for the studyconsists of USD swaption and cap prices. The swaptions data set comprisesvolatilities of swaptions of maturities 6 months, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5years,with the underlying swap maturities of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5years each. Thecap prices are for a tenmonth period March 1 December 31, 1998, acrossfour different strikes 6.5%, 7%, 7.5%, and 8% and four maturities 2, 3,4, and 5year.Some research has also been done regarding the importance of factors forpricing Bermudan swaptions. Longstaff, SantaClara and Schwartz 2001b44 show that exercise strategies based on onefactor models understate thetrue option value for Bermudans. They contend that the current market 9practice of using onefactor models leads to suboptimal exercise policies anda significant loss of value for the holders of these contracts. However, Andersen and Andreasen 2001 1 conclude that the standard market practiceof recalibrating onefactor models does not necessarily understate the priceof Bermudan swaptions. The authors do not investigate any hedging issueshowever. Pietersz and Pelsser 2005 47 compare single factor Markovfunction and multifactor market models for hedging Bermudan swaptions.They find that on most trade days the Bermudan swaption prices estimatedfrom these two models are similar and comove together. Their results alsoshow that delta and deltavega hedging performances of both models arecomparable. The delta hedge in their study is set up in terms of discountbonds, one discount bond for each tenor associated with the deal. In the caseof 10Y Bermudan with annual coupon, there are 11 such discount bonds.The hedging is carried out daily. For the swaptions, the option maturitiesrange from one month to five years while the swaps maturities range from 1 to 30 years.3 Description of Term Structure Models Implementation In this study, we compare the pricing and hedging performance of four ofthe most important term structure models, viz. HW, BK, SMM and LMM.In this section, we briefly describe the four models and their characteristics.3.1 The HullWhite and BK Model In the HullWhite model, also referred to as the extendedVasicek model,the instantaneous shortrate process evolves under the riskneutral measureas follows:drt t atrtdt tdz,1where t, at and t are deterministic functions of time. The function tis chosen so that the model fits the initial term structure of interest rates.The other two timevarying parameters, at and t, enable the model to be 10fitted to the initial volatility of all zero coupon rates and to the volatility ofshort rate at all future times.2 Hull and White 1994a 28, 1994b 29 note,however, that while at and t allow the model to be fitted to the volatilitystructure at time zero, the resulting volatility term structure could be nonstationary in the sense that the future volatility structure implied by themodel can be quite different from the volatility structure today. On theother hand, when these two parameters are kept constant, the volatilitystructure stays stationary but the models consistency with market pricesof e.g. caps or swaptions can suffer considerably. Thus there is a tradeoffbetween tighter fit and model stationary.In the HW model the distribution of short rate is Gaussian. Gaussiandistribution leads to a theoretical possibility of short rate going below zero.A model that addresses this negative interest rate issue is the Black and Karasinski 1991 6 model.In this model, the risk neutral process forlogarithm of the instantaneous spot rate, ln rt, isd ln rt t at ln rt dt tdz,2where r 0 at t 0 is a positive constant, t, at and t are deterministicfunctions of time as before.Both HW and BK model are implemented by constructing a recombiningtrinomial lattice for the shortterm interest rate following Hull and White1996 30, 2001 32.33.2 The Libor Market Model The Libor Market Model and the Swap Market Model described in thenext section have been popular among practitioners because it is consistentwith market standard of using Black formula to price caplets Europeanswaptions.Let Lit, i 1, 2,  N, as the forward Libor rates, and j be the interestrate reset interval between Tj and Tj1. The dynamics of forward Libor rate 2The initial volatility of all rates depends on 0 and at. The volatility of shortrate at future times is determined by t Hull and White 1996, p.9 30.3See Khan, Guan and Poon 2007 39 for further details.11under the Tn1 terminal measure is Ncid:88ji1d LitLitj Ljtijt1 j Ljt dt it d W QTn1t3for 0 t min Ti, Tn1 , i 1, , n, , N, where ijt is thecovariance between Lit and Ljt, and it is the volatility of Lit. Notethat if Bn1 t is the price of a zero coupon bond maturing at Tn1, then Lnt is driftless under the Tn1 terminal measure with Bn1 t as thenumeraire. This special case is called the forward measure and it leads tothe Black formula for caplet and floorlet.Unlike caplet valuation, to implement LMM for pricing swaptions, it isnecessary to simulate all forward rates under one measure. This means wehave to calculate the drift term for all Lnt under the terminal measure in3.Following Glasserman and Zhao 1999 22, the Euler discretizationscheme of the LMM dynamics under the TN 1 terminal measure in 3 is,for a time step h,2 ikh2h ikhhj1cid:184,4Lik 1h Likh expwherecid:183ikh 1ikh Ncid:88ji1Ljkhijkh1 Ljkh.One difficulty in implementing LMM is that the drift is statedependent.One therefore needs ways to approximate the evolution. The industry standard used to be Euler stepping using many steps, but Glasserman and Zhao1999 22 note that forward prices of bonds are not arbitrage free underthe Euler discretization scheme. Hence, predictorcorrector scheme is usedhere to make the drift approximation more accuratesee Hunter, Joshi and Jackel 2001 23 for more details. For the Euler stepping, we have thefollowing approximationcid:90 T Ncid:881 Ljt ijijdt Ncid:88Ljtji1ikh SSji1cid:90 Tcid:90 TLjS1 LjSSijijdt512For the predictorcorrector method, we frist estimate the Libor rates using Euler stepping in 5 and use the resulting forward rates to adjust the drift.The adjusted drift is used to recompute Libor rate LiT using the same setof random numbers. Thus the following equation is used instead of equation5cid:90 TScid:181Ncid:88ji1ikh 12LjT 1 LjT LjS1 LjSijijdt6cid:182cid:90 TS3.3 The Swap Market Model The modeling framework of the SMM is similar to that of the LMM, butthe SMM has not been as intensively studied as the LMM. Here, we usea particular version of coterminal swap market model. Given the tenorstructure, a coterminal Swap Market Model refers to a model which assignsthe arbitrage free dynamic to a set of forward swap rates that have differentswap starting date Tn n 1, , M 1 but all conclude on the samematurity date TM . One important feature about the coterminal swaptionis that it is internally consistent with a Bermudan swaption that gives theholder the right to enter into a swap at each reset date during period T1 to TM1 with TM being the terminal maturity of the underlying swap. Whenconsidering, at each tenor date, whether or not to exercise the option toenter into a swap contract, the holder needs to consider the forward swaprate dynamics from that tenor date until final maturity.The advantage of coterminal SMM over other market models in pricing Bermudan swaptions has already been noted and discussed in Jamshidian1997 34 and Galluccio, Huang, Ly and Scaillet 2007 20. Furthermore,Galluccio, Huang, Ly and Scaillet 2007 20 use graph theory to classifythe admissible market models into coinitial, cosliding and coterminalsubgroups. They show that the LMM is the only admissible model forswaps of a cosliding type.In Galluccio et al 2007 20, the coterminal SMM is defined by introducing a collection of mutually equivalent probability measures and afamily of Brownian motions such that all forward swap rates satisfy the 13Mcid:80in1chosen SDE. Let Cn,M t Bi t represent the value of the annuityfrom Tn1 to TM . Bi t is the ith bond price at time t and is the interestrate reset interval we assume all intervals are the same for simplicity. Thecoterminal forward swap rates satisfy the following general SDE under theterminal measure QM1,M with CM1,M t as the numeraire:d Sn,M t Sn,M t n,M t d W M1,M drift for n 1, , M 1 7t We follow Joshi and Liesch 2007 36, who recommend using the crossvariation in assessing the impact of changing numeraire on the drift in 7.The drift of a forward swap rate Sn,M t, n 1, , M 1 under theterminal measure QM1,M is given by:EM1,M d Sn,M t n,M CM1,M tCn,M tBn t Bm tCn,M tcid:191CM1,M tcid:192cid:191 CM1,M tCn,M tSn,M t ,8cid:192,Cn,M tCn,M tCM1,M tFcid:80Note that when n M 1, M1,M 0 because cid:104Sn,M t , 1cid:105 0. Here ., . means the quadratic variation.In Joshi and Liesch 2007 36, the Sn,M t term inside the square brackets is simplified into F independent Wiener process Wk. For one factormodel, all correlation terms n,m 1 and hence can be ignored. The correlation term has to be explicitly included when the dimension of Wk is twoor more, however. Expanding the crossvariation term in equation 8, thedrift becomes a complicated function of numeraire and crossvariation oftwo forward swap rates. By induction, the general form of drift under theterminal measure can also be written as:k1i1M2cid:88inicid:89jn1n,M Ci1,MCM1,Mn,i1Sn,M n,M Si1,M i1,M1 j Sj,M 9Details of the derivation are given in the working paper by Gan, Guan and Poon 2007 19. The above equation is not an explicit function of Sn,M tfor n 1, , M 1, because the Cn,M term is derived from a set of Si,M t14for n i M 1. This drift term is complicated in appearance but is quitestraightforward to compute.The SMM is implemented using Monte Carlo simulations using the predictorcorrector drift approximation for more accuracy. This is done in a similarway to the LMM case in equation 5.

This approach is appropriate here since the problem we have at hand is narrowly focused.In this study, the objective isto price and hedge 10 1 Bermudan. For this 10 1 Bermudan swaption,the most relevant calibrating instruments are the 1 10, 2 9, 3 8, ,10 1 coterminal European swaptions. An n m swaption is an nyear European option to enter into a swap lasting for m years after option maturity. These European swaptions are the closest hedging instruments forthe Bermudan. When fully calibrated, the pricing error of these individualinstruments are minimized and should therefore be the closest to achieving 15noarbitrage condition. Hence, the 10 ATM coterminal European swaptions are used to calibrate the four interest rate models for pricing the 101Bermudan swaption.4 In the subsequent unwinding period, when the modelsare used for pricing the 9 1 Bermudan swaption we use the correspondingnine ATM coterminal European swaptions, i.e., 1 9, 2 8, , 9 1, tocalibrate the term structure models.4.2 Model Calibration All four TS models are noarbitrage interest rate models in the sense thatthey could exactly match the current term structure of interest rates. Both HW and BK have meanreverting drift. Practitioners and econometriciansoften use historical data for inferring the rate of mean reversion e.g., Candelon and GilAlana 2006 13.Bermudan swaptions are typically hedged with coterminal atthemoney European swaptions. Thus, the coterminal swaption implied volatilities areused as the common calibration instrument for all the four models.Given the calibrating instruments, the immediate question that follows isthe specification of the parameters. Since we are dealing with only 1factormodels, we do not need to consider the functional form of the correlationcoefficient. The only specification needed is that for volatilities t for theshort rate models. For the short rate model, there should be eleven volatilityparameters, 0, 1,  , 10. We use the European swaption prices to calibrate 0, 3, 11 and assume the other volatility parameters are linear interpolations of these three estimates. The volatility functions for LMM and SMMare more complicated and described, in full detail, in Section 5.2 and 5.3.Given that the European swaption prices are quoted in Black impliedvolatility, the only model that is consistent with these Black implied volatility is the SMM. So for the SMM, we can fit the Black implied volatilitydirectly using the prespecified volatilities specification and obtain parameter values without calculating the European swaption prices.Since swap rates are linear combinations of forward rates with stochastic 4Pietersz and Pelsser 2005 47 follow the same approach.16weights, it follows that swap rate dynamics are also fully determined oncethe volatilities and correlations of the forward rates have been specified.In practice, it is extremely important to ascertain the implications for thedynamics of the swap rates, given a particular choice of dynamics for theforward rates and vice versa. Jackel and Rebonato 2003b 38 producean approximate closed form solution for the pricing of European swaptionsunder the LMM framework based on lognormally evolving forward rates.5Using the total variance of the lognormal swap rate in conjunction with the Black formula, one can price European swaptions with a remarkable degreeof accuracy. Let n M t denote the volatility at time t of a swap rate SRn M expiring n years from today and maturing M years thereafter.

Instead ofminimizing the sum of squared percentage price errors, we could have minimized the sum of squared errors in prices. However, such a minimizationstrategy would place more weights on the expensive instruments. Minimization of squared percentage pricing error is typically used as a goodnessoffitmeasure for similar calibrations in the literature and by practitioners.4.3 Testing the Hedging Performance Let t denote a particular month in the sample period from February 2005to September 2007. The procedure for calibrating, hedging and unwindinga 10 1 Bermudan swaption are as follows:i At month t, an interest rate model is calibrated to 10 ATM coterminal European swaptions underlying the 10 1 ATM Bermudan swaptionby minimizing the root mean square of the percentage pricing errors.ii The calibrated model from i is then used to price the 10 1 ATMBermudan swaption at t, and to calculate the hedge ratios using, ashedge instruments, 1year, 5year and 11year swaps. At the time of 18initiation, t, the values of all three swaps 1year, 5year and 11yearare zero.iii A delta hedged portfolio is formed by minimizing the amount of deltamismatch i.e., the delta of the portfolio of the Bermudan swaptionand the swaps has to be as close to zero as possible.iv At time t 1 i.e. one year later, the interest rate model is calibratedto 9 coterminal ATM European swaptions 9 1, 8 2,   underlyingthe Bermudan swaption in ii which is now 9 1.v The calibrated model from iv is used to price the 9 1 Bermudanswaption using the strike rate determined in ii. The time t 1 yieldcurve is used to price the three swaps in ii, which are now 0year,4years and 10year to maturity.vi The profit and loss is calculated for the delta hedged portfolio formedat t and unwound at t 1 with any net cash flow at t suitably compounded.vii Steps i to vi are repeated every month for t1, t2, till T where T is the last month of the sample period for the hedging exercise.viii The whole process from i to vii is performed four times since wehave four competing term structure interest rate models.4.4 Data To perform the valuation and hedging analysis described above, the followingdata sets are collected from Datastream:a Monthly prices quoted in Black implied volatility of ATM Europeanswaptions in Euro and USD. Two sets of implied volatilities were collected: from February 2005 to September 2006, prices of coterminal ATM European swaptions underlying the 10 1 Bermudan swaption,and from February 2006 to September 2007, prices of coterminal ATMEuropean swaptions underlying the 9 1 Bermudan swaption. These 19prices are quoted in Black implied volatility. The implied volatilitymatrix downloaded has a number of missing entries especially in theearlier part of the sample period. The missing entries were filled inusing loglinear interpolation following Brigo and Morini 2005, p 9,24 and 25 9.b Annual yields, R0,t, for maturities up to 11 years are downloaded from Datastream. For short rate models, these annual yields are convertedinto continuously compounded yields using r 0,t ln1 R0,t, whichin turns are converted into discrete forward and swap rates as inputin the LMM and SMM, respectively.c Monthly data of the annual yield curve for the period January 1999to July 2007, i.e. total 103 observations are downloaded for Euro and USD. This data was transformed into discrete forward rates for usein the principal component analysis.iv Monthly data of 1month yield for the period January 2000 to July 2007 was downloaded for estimating the meanreversion parameterof the short rate model. In the implementation, a time step t of 0.1 year is used for constructing the trinomial tress, which means thatthe rates on nodes of the tree are continuously compounded tperiodrates. All the required yields are linearly interpolated from these annual yields. At the very short end, the 0.1 year rate is approximatedby the 1month rate.All monthly data are collected for the last business day of the month inthe sample period.5 Model Calibration Before we price Bermudan swaptions, we need to find the parameters thatgive the correct European swaptions to avoid any arbitrage opportunities.This section discusses the calibration method for each model.205.1 HWBK Model Calibration To calibrate the model in 1 or 2, we need to fix t, t and at. Giventhe models are recalibrated every month, it does not make sense to allowthe long term mean reversion rate to change every month. Here, we havedecided to fix the mean reversion rate at a and estimate a from historicaltime series of 1month yield following the approach of Candelon and GilAlana 2006 13. The discretised version of the HW model in 1 withat a is as follows:rt1 rt t art t1,rt1 t 1 art t1,14where t1 is a draw from a normal distribution. Equation 14 representsan AR1 process. An ordinary least square OLS estimate of coefficient1 a in equation 14 would be 61 a rt1rt a 1 2rtwhere is the correlation coefficient between rt1 and rt. For the BK modelwe perform this regression using time series of lnr, where as before r, is 1month interest rate as the time step in the trinomial tree is 0.1.There can be different ways to parameterize t. It could be piecewiselinear, piecewise constant or t could follow some parametric functionalform.In this study, we chose to fix t at three fixed points: 0, 3 and 11 for the 10x 1 Bermudan swaption. These three volatility parameters areestimated through the calibration process.7 The volatilities for the timeperiods in between these points are linearly interpolated. For the 9 16For the regression yi xi i, the OLS estimate of isxy xyxy 2xy 7We are very grateful to Peter Van de Wal for making this suggestion, which made thecalibration exercise a lot more manageable.21Bermudan swaptions, the fixed point used are 0, 2 and 10. All thevolatility parameters are bounded between 0.0001 and 1.5.2 Libor Market Model Calibration We observed in the previous section that, in LMM, the joint evolution offorward Libor rates under the chosen pricing measure is fully determined bytheir instantaneous volatilities and correlations. Among the different parameterizations of the volatility term structure proposed in the literature, weadopt the one suggested by Rebonato 1999 50 which is tested extensivelyin the literature. The parametric form in Rebonato 1999 50 isit ia bTi tecTit d15where i is specified for each i and a, b, c, d are parameters which arebounded in the range reported in Table 1.8Table 1: The paramters range Parameter Range1 to 11 to 10 to 50 to 0.5abcd Assume the base case scenario is a 0.08, b 0.06, c 0.40 andd 0.15. Now we plot the graphs of the impact of each parameters on theshape of the volatility curve in Figure 1. Parameter a influence the shortend of the volatility; parameter b has more impact on the humped shape ofthe curve; the volatility funcion appears to be not sensitive to the value ofparameter c, and parameter d determine the volatility level.In contrast to, e.g., a piecewiseconstant, this parametric specificationof the instantaneous volatility preserves the qualitative shape of the implied 8See http:www.fincad.comsupportdeveloper FuncmathrefLIBORMarket Model.htm.22,80.0asaseulavretemaraplaitinihtiwepahsytilitalovehtnoretemaraphcaefotcapmifoelpmax E:1erugi F.51.0ddna 04.0c,60.0b 23Impact of a 00.050.10.150.20.250.30.350.41234567891011Timeabcd function valuea0.08a0.02a0.12a0.22Impact of b 00.050.10.150.20.250.30.350.40.450.51234567891011Timeabcd function valueb0.06b0.16b0.26b0.36Impact of c 00.020.040.060.080.10.120.140.160.180.21234567891011Timeabcd function valuec0.4c0.5c0.6c0.7Impact of d 00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.81234567891011Timeabcd function valued0.34d0.44d0.54d0.64volatility observed in the market, i.e., a hump at around year two.In afull calibration, i is different for each European swaption. Here, we seti 1 so that the calibration procedure and the degree of freedom arecomparable to those of the short rate models.9105.3 Swap Market Model Calibration Brigo, Mercurio and Morini 2003 8, Rebonato 2002 51, among others,contribute to the parameterisation and calibration of the LMM. Based ontheir research, Galluccio et al 2007 20 test calibration of coterminal SMMusing similar functional form as the one advocated by Rebonato 2002 51in 15. By calibrating to swaption and caplet ATM volatilities, Galluccioet. al 2007 get different set of parameters j, aj, bj, cj, dj where j 1, , M 1 for M 1 number of coterminal swaptions under differentforward measure. Since the model we implement here is under one measure,and the volatility of different coterminal swap rates affect the drift terms ina complicated way, it is unrealistic to use different parameter set for differentcoterminal swaption. Therefore, we adopt only one volatility form and thefour parameters are common to volatilities of all coterminal swaptions. Weassue the volatility for the swap rate Sn,M t followsn,M t n, a, b, c, d a bn ecn d, for T0 n TM 16where n Tn t. The parameters a, b, c, and d are calibrated directlyto the implied volatilities of the set of coterminal swaptions with differentmaturities but associated with same length of swaps. Because of its simpleloglinear character, the calibration algorithm for this parametric formula isquite fast and robust. Again, the fitted volatility function can preserve thewellknown humped shape of market quoted Black implied volatility.9NAG C Sequential Quadratic Programming algorithm is used to find the parametersof the caplet volatility so that the root mean square error of the differences between theapproximated swaption volatility and market data is minimized.10The correlation between Libor rates is set to 1 in the onefactor LMM. The assumptionis comparable with the properties of the short rate models.245.4 Calibration Results In comparison, the short rate models calibration is relatively computationally costly as they do not have an analytical approximation formula for European swaptions. For the LMM, the calibration is fast with the approximation formula which links swap rate volatility to caplet volatility.The SMM model is straightforward and faster since it calibrates directly onswaption volatilities.Calibration results are summarized in Table 2. The calibration of 11year European coterminal swaptions is performed on the last business dateof each month from February 2005 to September 2006. The calibration of 10year European coterminal swaptions, on the other hand, is performed onthe last business date of each month from February 2006 to September 2007.All the root mean square percentage pricing errors are reported in Table 2.Figure 2 presents the same information by date and Figure 3 reproduces theresults and arrange them according to contract maturity.It is clear that the pricing error of the two short rate models are similar,whereas the pricing errors of the two market models are similar. Exceptfor 11year USD market, the short rate model errors are smaller than thoseof the market models. Although the short rate models are, supposedly,less flexible, it is implemented with a smaller time step, i.e., 0.1 year. Themarket models are calibrated by fitting the volatility functions directly tothe swaption Black implied volatilities. Such a pricing error result was quiteunexpected and is useful information for practice.The other key issue in model calibration is the stability of the parameterscalibrated. The calibrated parameter values are reported in Table 3 and 4 Table 3 for Euro market and Table 4 for USD market and presented in Figure 4. All parameters, except the parameter c of LMM and SMM, arereasonably stable through time. The voalitility is insenstive to parameter c.The stability of the model parameter values will have a direct impact onthe hedging result.

To the best of our knowledge, Longstaff, Schwartz and SantaClara LSS hereafter, 2001a 43 are the first to investigate this subject.They study the costs of applying singlefactor exercise strategies to Americanswaptions when the term structure is actually driven by multiple factors.However, LSS does not directly consider the effects of applying within ahighdimensional model a simple exercise strategy parameterized exclusivelyin intrinsic swap value. Comparing this strategy with a more complicatedexercise rule that is allowed to depend on more information about the stateof the forward curve, they find that the latter leads to an increase in modelgenerated option prices, typically in the order of 1 3%. From this result,LSS conclude that Bermudan swaptions holders following onefactor exercisestrategies suffer significant losses.In contrast, Andersen and Andreasen2001 1 argue that the LSS paper does not provide a conclusive analysisof the consequences of market practices. The approach taken in LSS does notconsider the recalibration procedures employed in practice, and also offerno evidence that their simple exercise strategy within a multifactor modelwill be representative of any or all of the possible exercise strategies that canbe implied from a bestfit one factor model. Andersen and Andreasen 20011 use meanreverting Gaussian model and lognormal Libor Market Modelfor pricing Bermudan swaption. They find that for both models, Bermudanswaption prices change only moderately when the number of factors in theunderlying interest rate model is increased from one to two.We use recombining trinomial tree for pricing Bermudan swaptions withshort rate models. Early exercise decision is straightforward in trinomialtree. For Swap Market Model and Libor Market Model, we perform Monte Carlo simulation with 10,000 simulation paths using LongstaffSchwartzleast square method to approximate the early exercise decision. As thereis no market quote for Bermudan swaptions which are mostly traded on OTC, we compare the price calculated from HW, BK, SMM and LMM. Asall the four models have been widely used by practitioners, it is reasonable 32to expect that interest rate derivative values produced should not be toodrastically different otherwise, they cannot coexist. So it is possible that,when calibrated to the same instruments, all four models might give similarprices for the same Bermudan swaption. We price both 11year and 10year Bermudan swaptions. The 11year Bermudan swaptions are priced atthemoney while 10year Bermudan swaptions are priced using the strike ratesset when they were 11year ATM in the previous year. The pricing resultsare summarized in Table 5 for Euro and Table 6 for USD.As we can see from Tables 5 and 6 and Figure 5, the prices given byfour models are quite close on most dates. The 11year Bermudans are all ATM. The 10year Bermudan swaptions, however, would be inthemoneyor outthemoney depending on how the interest rates had moved.It isvery encouraging to see that, again, prices produced by all four models aresimilar and comove together.7 Hedging Bermudan Swaption Changes in the term structure can significantly affect the value of any interest rate sensitive instruments. Therefore, protecting fixed income securitiesfrom unfavorable term structure movements, or hedging, is one of the mostdemanding tasks for any financial institution and for the ALM group in particular. Inefficient hedging strategies can cost these institutions dearly. Inorder to protect a position from adverse future interest rate changes, firstone needs to generate realistic scenarios and assess the impact of these riskscenarios. Thus, two important issues to be addressed by any interest ratemodel risk are: i how to perturb the term structure to imitate possibleterm structure movements; and ii how to immunize the portfolio againstthese movements.In the following subsections, we explain the methodologies, applied in this study, fori estimating the perturbations by which the input term structure shouldbe bumped to simulate the possible future changes;ii selecting hedge instruments;33Table 5: 11Y and 10Y Bermudan swaption prices in EUR market from February 2005 to September 2007.34DATE11YHWBKSMMLMM20052280.04650.04410.04630.046020053310.04670.04410.04790.048020054290.04760.04470.04810.048520055310.04910.04600.04990.050120056300.05080.04740.05340.054920057290.04850.04550.04840.047820058310.04860.04550.04830.047520059300.04640.04380.04580.0464200510310.04590.04370.04500.0453200511300.04520.04320.04440.0448200512300.04290.04140.04150.041520061310.04110.03980.03950.039320062280.03960.03840.03790.037620063310.03860.03760.03750.037420064280.03870.03770.03860.039020065310.03960.03840.03970.040420066300.03860.03760.03840.038720067310.03870.03760.03820.038520068310.03890.03790.03840.038620069290.03810.03730.03790.0382DATE10YHWBKSMMLMMStrike 20062280.02710.02720.02730.02710.040220063310.03790.03670.03650.03640.039520064280.05340.05100.05190.05210.037720065310.06100.05820.05910.05920.036320066300.07440.07200.07220.07230.034420067310.06100.05840.05850.05860.035620068310.06000.05730.05750.05760.033920069290.05450.05220.05190.05220.0344200610310.04170.04040.03990.03970.0369200611300.03900.03780.03710.03690.0371200612290.05630.05430.05400.05370.035720071310.05260.05080.05040.05020.037720072280.04430.04270.04230.04220.037820073300.03790.03320.03280.03290.040920074300.03080.03010.02930.02900.043120075310.03910.03800.03700.03690.043320076290.04760.04610.04640.04660.044220077310.04870.04710.04730.04740.042820078310.05100.04920.05020.05040.040820079280.05780.05570.05730.05760.0401Note:HWstandsfor HullWhitemodel,BKstandsfor BlackKarasinskimodel,SMMstandsfor Swap Market Modeland LMMstandsfor Libor Market Model.11y Bermudanswaptionarepriceedasatthemoneyfrom February 2005to September 2006;10year Bermudanswaptionsarepricedwiththecorresponding 11y ATMstrikesoneyearago.Forexample,on February 2006,thestrikeratefor 10y Burmudanswaptionis 0.0402whichisthe ATMstrikeratefor 11y Bermudan swaption on February 2005. 10y Bermudan swaption are priced from February 2006 to September 2007.Table 6: 11Y and 10Y Bermudan swaption prices in USD market from February 2005 to September 2007.35DATE11YHWBKSMMLMM20052280.05430.05280.05620.057620053310.05260.05160.05680.059720054290.05520.05390.05740.059220055310.05450.05320.05550.056620056300.05570.05460.05700.058220057290.05120.05080.05290.053920058310.05370.05310.05470.055820059300.05220.05180.05320.0540200510310.05170.05150.05310.0542200511300.05430.05410.05450.0552200512300.05250.05260.05200.052120061310.05170.05170.05000.049520062280.04700.04750.04300.041520063310.04870.04860.04590.044820064280.04700.04650.04550.045020065310.04850.04830.04630.045420066300.04650.04640.04320.042020067310.04800.04770.04460.043420068310.04880.04840.04410.042420069290.04930.04890.04480.0431DATE10YHWBKSMMLMMStrike 20062280.04720.04680.04300.04180.049620063310.05070.04970.04710.04640.052220064280.07410.07130.07010.06980.048220065310.08480.08170.08020.07980.046420066300.09260.08990.08830.08770.045420067310.06960.06700.06430.06350.048620068310.07160.06880.06530.06400.045620069290.05340.05190.04850.04730.0492200610310.04220.04190.03830.03680.0520200611300.03690.03720.03490.03380.0517200612290.04640.04530.04280.04180.050320071310.04670.04550.04240.04290.051220072280.03930.03880.03720.03660.051420073300.03370.03360.03270.03190.054820074300.02710.02770.02700.02640.057320075310.03080.03110.02890.02760.057720076290.03850.03810.03710.03680.058520077310.04600.04530.04530.04510.056620078310.04470.04370.04580.04670.053820079280.05060.04910.05260.05470.0525Note:HWstandsfor HullWhitemodel,BKstandsfor BlackKarasinskimodel,SMMstandsfor Swap Market Modeland LMMstandsfor Libor Market Model.11y Bermudanswaptionarepriceedasatthemoneyfrom February 2005to September 2006;10year Bermudanswaptionsarepricedwiththecorresponding 11y ATMstrikesoneyearago.Forexample,on February 2006,thestrikeratefor 10y Burmudanswaptionis 0.0402whichisthe ATMstrikeratefor 11y Bermudan swaption on February 2005. 10y Bermudan swaption are priced from February 2006 to September 2007.Figure 5: 11Y and 10Y Bermudan swaption prices in EUR and USD markets from February 2005 to September 2007.36Note: HW stands for HullWhite model, BK stands for BlackKarasinski model, SMMstands for Swap Market Model and LMM stands for Libor Market Model.

Parallel shifts are unambiguously the most important kind of yieldcurve shift but alone cannot completely explain the variations of yield curvemovements observed in the markets. Three most commonly observed termstructure shifts are: Parallel Shift, where the entire curve goes up or downby same amount; Tilt, also known as slope shift, in which short yields falland long yields rise or vice versa; and Curvature shift, in which short andlong yields rise while midrange yields fall or vice versa. These three typesof term structure movements together can explain almost all the variationspresent in any termstructure and thus one should not completely rely onduration and convexity measures for estimating the risk sensitivity of a fixedincome position. There are numerous examples in the literature to supportthis argument. Here, we mention a few studies that lead to this conclusion. Litterman and Scheikman 1991 41 perform principal componentsanalysis PCA and found that, on average, the first three factors can explain 98.4% of the variations in Treasury bond returns. They suggested thatby considering the effects of each of these three factors on a portfolio, onecan achieve a better hedged position than by holding only a zerodurationportfolio.11 Knez, Litterman, and Scheikman 1994 40 investigate thecommon factors in money markets and find that, on average, the first three 11Litterman and Scheikman 1991, page 54 41.37factors explain 86% of the total variations in most money market returnswhereas four factors can explain, on average, 90% of the variations. Chenand Fu 2002 12 perform a PCA on yield curve and find that the first fourfactors capture over 99.99% of the yield curve variations. They too claimthat hedging against these factors would lead to a more stable portfolio andthus superior hedging performance.Based on the findings of these studies, we perform PCA on historical datato estimate historical term structure shifts. There are not many examplesin interest rate derivative literature of estimating price sensitivities withregard to multiple factors like 3 principal components here in the contextof a onefactor term structure model. Generally, the risk sensitivities areoften calculated by perturbing only the model intrinsic factors, i.e. for theonefactor model, only onefactor is perturbed and so on.In this study, PCA has been performed on annual changes of forward Libor rates. Annual changes have been used because each hedge is maintained for one year. The reason for using forward rates rather than the spotyield curve for doing PCA is due to findings in Yallup 2006 53. Using Gilt coupon bond and Gilt strips, he uses various spline method to modelthe term structure as a polynomial. He finds that the smoothed forwardrate splines have the required combination of both low outofsample errorsand low forward rate curvature. The smoothed discount rate spline does nothave the required outofsample fit and forward rate curvature properties.Here, scores of the first three principal components of the changes of forwardcurves are used to estimate the shifts by which we bumped the forward ratecurves.Tables 7, 8 and Figure 6 present our PCA results, which appear to be inline with the findings in the literature, e.g., Knez, Litterman, and Scheikman1994 40.Next, we briefly describe how PCA was performed on the forward ratesin order to estimate the term structure shiftsbumps in the hedging study:i Monthly observations of 11 forward Libor rates L0,0,1, L0,1,2, L0,2,3,  , L0,10,11for the period January 1999 to December 2006 have been used for PCA.38Table 7: PCA factor loadings of Libor rates from January 2000 to September 2007.Table 8: Explainary power of the first three principle components.39EURUSDRates PCA1EURPCA2EURPCA3EURPCA1USDPCA2USDPCA3USD10.360.630.640.470.690.4920.430.340.290.460.220.3930.410.090.400.380.030.4140.350.050.280.300.130.3450.320.130.140.280.220.0960.280.210.020.250.230.0170.270.260.120.230.250.1580.200.310.140.200.270.2190.200.290.190.200.270.28100.190.290.290.170.270.33110.180.280.320.170.270.26EURPercentagevariance Cumulativevariance USDPercentagevarariance Cumulativevarariance PCA182.37%82.37%PCA174.22%74.22%PCA213.87%96.24%PCA220.59%94.81%PCA32.81%99.05%PCA32.96%97.77%Figure 6: Factor loadings for the first three principle components of forwardrates term structure in the EUR and USD markets 403DFWRURDGLQJ5DWHVRDGLQJV3853863DFWRURDGLQJ5DWHVRDGLQJV3853863DFWRURDGLQJ5DWHVRDGLQJV385386ii We calculate annual changes for each of the 11 forward rates as follows.Suppose we have at time t monthly observations of the 11 forwardrates, Lt,tj ,tj 1, where j 0, 1, 2,  , 10. The annual change ofeach of the forward Libor rates can be calculated as Lt,, Lt,, Lt 12,,iii Principal component analysis was performed on the eleven time seriesof Lt,, to produce principal factor loadings and the factor scores.The other output from the PCA are the proportion of variations explained by each principal component.iv From the PCA results to be discussed later, we chose to concentrateon the first three factors. Each of these factors were perturbed in orderto calculate the delta of the Bermudan swaptions and the hedginginstruments w.r.t the factor. For each forward rate, Lt,tj ,tj 1and each factor k,Lt,j ,j 1 j ,k Pk Lt,j ,j 1k Lt,j ,j 1 j ,k Pkfor j 0, 1, 2,  , 10 and Pk is the vector of scores for the kth factor,and k 1, 2, 3.There are many ways of setting Pk; here, we have decided to usethe mean of absolute change calculated from the entire sample period.So Pk is the same for all t. Figure 7 presents the mean of absolutechange for the first three principle factors.v After performing the regressions in step iv, the 11 forward rates arebumped by shocks corresponding to the first three factors as:Lt,j ,j 1 L0,j ,j 1 j,k Pk, j 0,  , 11, k 1, 2, 3.This gives us 6 new sets of term structure, along with the originalinput term structure for each of the days on which we will hedge the Bermudan swaption.41Figure 7: PCA factor loadings mean of the absolute change for thefirst three principle components in EUR and USD markets.42P1P2P3EUR0.01805620.007835540.00357607USD0.02361240.01224420.00478759Mean of first Three Principal Components PCA Loading for Factor 100000001234567891011Rates P1EuroP1USDPCA Loading for Factor 20.01000.00800.00600.00400.00200.00000.00200.00401234567891011Rates Value P2EuroP2USDPCA Loading for Factor 3302010001020301234567891011Rates P3EuroP3USD7.2 Choosing the Hedge Instruments In the literature there are two main approaches to hedging: factor hedgingand bucket hedging. For factor hedging in a Kfactor model, typically Kdifferent instruments together with the money market account are used ashedging instruments. The choice of hedge instruments is independent of thederivative to be hedged i.e., the same K hedging instruments can be used forhedging any derivative in a Kfactor model, and depend only on the numberof factors in the model. For bucket hedging the choice of hedge instrumentsdepend on the instrument to be hedged and not on the number of factorsin the model.In this hedging strategy, the number of hedge instruments isequal to the number of total payoffs provided by the instrument. The hedgeinstruments are chosen so their maturities correspond to different paymentor decision dates of the underlying derivative.When using any other criteria for selecting the hedge instruments, thenumber of hedge instruments will lie between the numbers of hedge instruments associated with these two hedging strategies. Before discussing theinstruments that are used in this study to deltahedge the Bermudan swaption,we first briefly review a few previous studies in the literature. Driessen,Klaassen and Melenberg 2003 16 used delta hedging of caps and swaptions as criteria for comparing the hedge performance of HJM class models and the Libor Market Model. They used zero coupon bonds as hedgeinstruments. For each model, they considered factor and bucket hedgingstrategies. DKM show that when bucket strategies are used for hedging,the performance of the onefactor models improves significantly. Fan, Guptaand Ritchken 2007 18 compare the swaption delta neutral hedging performance of single factor and multifactor factor term structure models using discount bonds as hedge instruments to deltahedge swaptions. Theyconclude that multifactor models outperform single factor models. Nextin light of the DKM results, they repeated their experiments using additional hedging instruments. They find that for both the onefactor and thetwofactor model adding more instruments did not result in better hedgingresults. The general implications of these examples are:43i Effectiveness of delta neutral hedges is often used to evaluate the hedging performance of term structure models.ii Using multiple instruments can improve the hedge performance of onefactor models. Practitioners also prefer this practice called buckethedging.Therefore, in this study, we decide to use three swaps of different maturities 1, 5 and 11year, as hedge instruments. Maturity of 11year swapcoincides with the maturity of the coterminal Bermudan swaption to behedged and the length of the other two swaps is used to hedge the shortand medium term interest rate risk. We could have used discount bonds tohedge this Bermudan swaption but the use of swap is cheaper and is morein line with the general practice in banks.127.3 Constructing Delta Hedged Portfolio Delta hedging is the process of keeping the delta of the hedged portfolio asclose as possible to zero. Since delta measures the exposure of a derivativeto the changes in the value of the underlying, the overall value of a portfolioremains unchanged for small changes in the underlying factor. A deltahedged portfolio is established by buying or selling an amount of the hedgeinstruments that corresponds to the delta of the exposure.For interest rate derivatives, if the entire initial term structure is perturbed by same amount, say parallel shift, then the risk sensitivity of afixed income security w.r.t. this perturbation can be estimated as V Vwhere V is the value of the derivative calculated using initial term structureand V is the value of the derivative after the initial term structure isperturbed by . If we first increase the entire initial term structure by andthen next decrease it by , then the risk sensitivity can estimated as V V 21712Pietersz and Pelsser 2005 47 used discount bonds to hedge Bermudan swaption.44where V is the value of the derivative calculated after initial term structure has been shifted up by and V is the value of the derivative afterthe initial term structure has been shifted down by . In our case we havebumped the initial forward rate curve by three factors. Also for each factor,we have bumped the forward rate curve both up and down. Using the ideapresented in equation 17, we estimate the sensitivity delta of the Bermudan swaption and the three swaps with respect to the three PCA factors asfollows Bermk BSwn Pkk S1S1Pkk S5S5Sk S11Pkk S11S1kk BSwn BSwn2Pkk S1S1k P P k S5S5k P P k S11S11k P P kkkkkkS5kk S12Pkk S52PkS11kk S112Pkkk and .for k 1, 2, 3, and S is the swap price and BSwn is the Bermudan swaption price, .k are, respectively, the prices of derivative after theinitial forward curve has been bumped up and down by the kth factor. Nowif we consider a portfolio, consisting of one long position in 101 Bermudanswaption, and some short position in x 11 units of 11year swap, x 5 units of 5year swap and x 1 units of 1year swap, then total delta mismatch of thisportfolio with respect to kth factor, k is x 11S11k BSwnk x 5S5k x 1S118kkassuming that x 11, x 5 and x 1 need not to be whole numbers. From equation18, we can see that when we use more than one hedging instrument ina onefactor model, the hedge ratios would not be unique, and some rulemust be applied for constructing the hedge portfolio using the chosen hedgeinstruments. Here, to obtain the hedge ratios, x 11, x 5 and x 1, we use thebasic idea behind the delta hedging. The three hedge ratios x 11, x 5 and x 1are obtained by minimizing the total deltamismatch of the portfolio with 45respect to the first three PCA factors, i.e.3cid:88k1minx 11,x 5,x 1k2where k is given by equation 18.7.4 Calculating PLOnce the hedging portfolio has been established on date t, the hedging errorcan be evaluated one year later at t 1 as follows:P Lt1 BSwnt x 11,t S11,t x 5,t S5,t x 1,t S1,t 1 y 0,tBSwnt1 x 11,t S10,t1 x 5,t S4,t1 x 1,t S0,t1 19where BSwnt is the value of the Bermudan swaption on day t; x,t are unitsof year swap in the hedge portfolio; S,t is the value of year swap on dayt; and y 0,t is the current 1year yield at t.Since, at the point of initiation, the value of any swap is zero, this meansthat S11,t S5,t S1,t 0. Therefore, equation 19 can be written as P Lt1 BSwnt1y 0,tBSwnt1x 11,t S10,t1x 5,t S4,t1x 1,t S0,t1.20To calculate the price of BSwnt1, which is now a 91 Bermudan swaption,we recalibrate at t 1, the interest rate models and use the new calibratedparameter values to calculate the model price of this possibly awayfrommoney 91 Bermudan swaption BSwnt1. Strike rate for this 91 Bermudan swaption is kept the same as it was for the 10 1 Bermudan swaptionon day t, as the objective is to find the current value of that old swaption.We also use the t 1 term structure to calculate the values of the threeswaps at t 1.The profit and loss of the hedged portfolio is reported in Table 9 and Figure 8. Figure 8 also report the hedging PL as a percentage of the average Bermudan swaption prices from the four models. The hedging performanceof all the short rate models HW and BK is better than forward rate modelsLMM and SMM in both Euro and USD market. We also notice that all 46the four models perform better in Euro market than in USD market. Thereason could be that the interest rate term structure is more volatile in the USD market than in the Euro market during our sample period.8 Conclusion The goal of this study is to provide an empirical comparison of four onefactor interest rate term structure models for the purpose of asset liabilitymanagement in a global bank. In contrast to previous research, we have compared four very different models and we performed the pricing and hedgingtests on Bermudan swaptions. We also use a more refined method in deltahedging the Bermudan swaption, used here to mimic the mortgage loanportfolio.For model calibration, we fix volatility term structure in HW and BKmodels at three time period and linearly interpolate between fixed points; forthe LMM and SMM, we use market standard parametric form for volatilityterm structure.Bermudan swaptions are priced via recombining trinomial tree with HWBK model while for SMM and LMM, Monte Carlo simulation with 10, 000 paths with predictorcorrector drift approximation is used. Thoughthe modeling approaches are vastly different, the percentage pricing errorfrom calibration results of all four models are quite small and most of thecalibrated parameters are relatively stable. Most of the time, the Bermudanprices of all four models are within the bidask spread. Thus, we concludethat, for ALM purpose, there is no significant difference between the fourpopular models though implementation wise, HW model involves less effortand the calibrated parameter values are relatively more stable.As far as hedging performance is concerned, in the Euro market, the PLof the hedged portfolio from the four models are very similar to each other.In the USD market, HW and BK models are marginally better than themore complicated SMM and LMM models. This would lead us to concludethat, again from an ALM perspective, we actually could use simple short 47Table 9: Hedging profit and loss in EUR and USD Markets.48EURHWBKSMMLMM200602280.00030.00510.00290.0012200603310.00260.00040.00460.0066200604280.00060.00060.00360.0047200605310.00070.00190.00570.0070200606300.00270.00080.00610.0089200607310.00080.00210.00520.0061200608310.00130.00270.00560.0061200609290.00220.00330.00600.0060200610310.00610.00560.00780.0080200611300.00680.00600.00810.0086200612290.00350.00630.00670.0067200701310.00360.00590.00610.0058200702280.00600.00760.00780.0074200703300.00500.00900.00970.0094200704300.00750.00700.00920.0096200705310.00670.00710.00990.0103200706290.00300.00450.00570.0055200707310.00170.00330.00420.0040200708310.00360.00600.00590.0054200709280.00370.00750.00580.0066RMSS0.00410.00530.00660.0070USDHWBKSMMLMM200602280.00470.00300.01210.0132200603310.00540.00410.01470.0160200604280.00470.00790.01380.0151200605310.00040.00440.00890.0097200606300.00240.00320.00780.0090200607310.00480.00860.01450.0153200608310.00640.01080.01690.0185200609290.00970.01050.01650.0176200610310.01150.00990.01690.0182200611300.01400.01100.01530.0159200612290.01560.01630.01860.0194200701310.01740.01850.02000.0188200702280.01330.01320.00890.0092200703300.01180.01090.00810.0091200704300.00690.00390.00250.0041200705310.01280.01140.01050.0121200706290.01040.01070.00730.0074200707310.00600.00660.00240.0023200708310.00730.00780.00020.0015200709280.00590.00760.00310.0041RMSS0.04330.04430.05530.0587Note: HW stands for HullWhite modle, BK stands for BlackKarasinskimodel, SMM stands for Swap Market Model and LMM stands for Libor Market Model.
