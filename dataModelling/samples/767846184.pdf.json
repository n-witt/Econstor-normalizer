Since 1990, the year when the Millennium Development Goal 4 MDG4 began to be monitored, developing countries have made important strides towards reducing child mortality.1 Over the last 20 years, child mortality rates have fallen considerably, from 87 85, 89 deaths per 1,000 live births to 51 51, 55.2 In absolute terms, this means a reduction from 12 to 6.9 million in the number of children dying every year UNICEF 2012. However, despite the progress in this front, more than 19,000 children still die every day, most of them of preventable and treatable infectious diseases. Indeed, child mortality rates remain high in developing countries, with rates about eight times as high as those observed in developed countries. Recent estimates suggest that nearly 80 per cent of underfive deaths occur in subSaharan Africa and Southern Asia, and about half of the deaths in one of five countries: India, Nigeria, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Pakistan, and China Black et al. 2010. India and Nigeria alone account for more than onethird of the child deaths worldwide. The fact that a large proportion of child deaths are caused by preventable and treatable infectious diseases is symptomatic of dysfunctional policy strategies and health systems in the developing world. In that context, assessing what works in tackling the main cause of child morbidity and mortality becomes critical for future policy actions. Acute respiratory infections, notably pneumonia, and diarrhoeal diseases are the first and second leading causes of death among young children, respectively. Pneumonia and diarrhoea alone lead to 1.6 and 1.3 million child deaths per year respectively, amounting to almost 3 million deaths in total Black et al. 2010. Young children are particularly vulnerable to the negative health implications of diarrhoeal infections such as poor nutritional absorption, dehydration, and susceptibility to infection. Prolonged periods of diarrhoea can cause malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies that increase the risk of contracting pneumonia while impairing growth and development of children World Health Organization 2003; EPH et al. 2004. Early malnutrition is also linked to poor cognitive functioning and learning capacity Scrimshaw 1998; Worobey et al. 2006, which in the longer term leads to lower labour productivity, and poverty Wagstaff and Watanabe 2000; Hoddinott et al. 2008; Grosse and Roy 2008. There is recent evidence of a decline in incidence and mortality rates due to diarrhoea and pneumonia among young children in developing countries Fischer Walker et al. 2012; EPH et al. 2004, with much attention on clinical interventions devoted to increasing the distribution of rotavirus vaccines, zinc supplements and oral rehydration salts ORS solutions to tackle the former disease, whereas antibiotics and immunization against haemophilus influenza type B, pneumococcus, measles and whooping cough pertussis to prevent the latter illness Desai et al. 2011; Todd et al. 2010; Gilani et al. 2012. Clinical interventions for diarrhoea and respiratory infections such as antibiotics, probiotics, and zinc have been implemented and assessed under various environmental settings Theodoratou et al. 2010; Traa et al. 2010; Dennehy 2012; SoaresWeiser et al. 2010; 1 The MDG 4 called for a twothirds reduction in the underfive mortality rates by 2015. 2 Values in brackets indicate 90 per cent uncertainly intervals, 1 Dinleyici et al. 2012; Das et al. 2010; Das et al. 2012; Lazzerini and Ronfani 2011. In contrast, the effectiveness of nonclinical interventions characterized by education and training programmes, andor improved sanitation, water supply, water quality, and hospital equipment is comparatively understudied. A recent review of training programmes for health professionals to improve care of seriously ill newborns in developing countries identified only two studies for inclusion Opiyo and English 2010. Existing reviews tend to focus on all age groups rather than young children specifically Esrey et al. 1985; Esrey et al. 1991; Fewtrell et al. 2005, or those residing outside of developing countries Rabie and Curtis 2006. The focus on small children, notably neonatal, and the health interventions that target that population subgroup is of particular significance, as the share of underfive mortality rates occurring at a very early age is increasing worldwide UNICEF 2012. To our knowledge, there are no systematic reviews that focus on nonclinical policy interventions aimed to reduce morbidity and mortality due to treatable diseases among young children in developing countries, despite the fact that there has been considerable attention to interventions that aim at enhancing the supply of resources andor social infrastructure that benefit the poor, and promoting changes in individual behaviour. This paper contributes to the existing literature on child wellbeing in two important respects: first, it presents a theory of change analytical framework that emerges from a systematic review conducted on nonclinical policy interventions against preventable and treatable childhood diseases, namely diarrhoeal and acute respiratory diseases. Second, the paper pays particular attention to policies that have been tested in a developing country context, and which focus on children as the primary target population. Overall, we find that public investment in sanitation and hygiene, water supply and quality, and the provision of medical equipment that detect symptoms of childhood diseases, along with training and education for medical workers, are effective instruments to reduce diarrhoeal diseases and acute respiratory infections. We find a wide range in terms of impact size, which reflects the various types of policy designs as well as the heterogeneity of socioeconomic environments in which these interventions have been implemented. There is no clear evidence to suggest that multifaceted policy designs are more effective than singlefocus interventions, particularly when focusing on young children. And although age seems to influence the degree of policy effectiveness, additional agedisaggregated research is needed to determine more precisely the impact of specific and combined interventions. The remaining of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the analytical framework based on a theory of change model, which is derived from the existing literature on nonclinical policy interventions for treatable childhood diseases in developing countries. Section 3 discusses the methodology and searching strategy adopted to conduct the systematic review, whereas Section 4 presents a synthesis of the evidence. Section 5 concludes with some reflections on the policy implications of our findings. 2 A theory of changebased typology Theory of change is a tool for developing solutions to complex social problems Anderson 2005. It is a participatory process involving the identification of conditions necessary for longterm goals to be achieved The Center for Theory of Change Inc. 2013. We focus on 2 nonclinical interventions that both complement and serve as channels through which preventive clinical devices e.g. vaccine immunizations and treatment innovations e.g. zinc supplements, oral rehydration salts, and antibiotic treatment of pneumonia are enhanced. We have identified two main drivers of change with regard to nonclinical interventions against diarrhoeal and respiratory diseases: first, policies that aim at enhancing supplyside capabilities in the area of material resources andor infrastructure and second, policies that aim at promoting behavioural change, primarily through information and education. We briefly describe below these types of policy approaches. 2.1 Enhancing supplyside capabilities We identify a number of interventions that aim at improving the allocation of resources andor infrastructure. Major types of policies for resource enhancement included sanitation and hospital upgrades, and improving water supply, its distribution, andor its quality. These types of nonclinical interventions are depicted in the first column on the lefthand side of Figure 1, and are often enhanced by intersecting with each other. Examples of improved water distribution include the installation of a hand pump in a community or connecting households to municipal water sources Kolahi et al. 2009; Tonglet et al. 1992; Semenza et al. 1998. Water quality interventions aim to improve water treatments to remove microbial contaminants, either at the source or in the household. Such interventions were frequently paired with the provision of improved water storage vessels. Graf et al. 2010 assessed a water quality improvement intervention via solar disinfection while others measured the impact of safe water storage containers, ceramic water filters and chlorine or other water disinfectants on the outcome Clasen et al. 2004; Jensen et al. 2003; Sobsey et al. 2003; Reller et al. 2003; Semenza et al. 1998. Interventions featuring sanitation improvements include Daniels et al. 1990s assessment of the impact of latrine ownership on diarrhoeal morbidity and Oberhelman et al. 2006s study on the health impact of corralling freerange household chickens. A large cluster of interventions involve sanitation enhancements combined with hygiene education or promotion aspects. For instance, Sircar et al. 1987 evaluated the impact of a project which combined handwashing, hygiene education, and soap provision, while an intervention assessed by Han and Hlaing 1989 included the provision of soap and instructions for mothers and children to wash their hands after defecation, and before preparing and eating their three main meals per day. Similarly, Shahid et al. 1996 and Luby et al. 2004 assessed the impact of a handwashing initiative consisting of the provision of soap along with regular surveillance and reinforcement of health messages of the benefits of handwashing. Additional multipronged interventions are assessed by Garrett et al. 2008; Aziz et al. 1990; Hoque et al. 1996; Rana 2009; Quick et al. 1999; Luby et al. 2006; Alam et al. 1989; and Lockwood et al. 2001. 2.2 Promoting behavioural change The promotion of behavioural change represents another major driver to reduce child mortality and morbidity. These types of nonclinical interventions are depicted in the second column, or cluster of policies, located on the lefthand side of Figure 1. The intended target of 3 Figure 1: Theory of change flow diagram Source: Authors. 4 such interventions is related to disease type. Interventions focused on diarrhoealrelated morbidity andor mortality are commonly aimed at mothers of young children, while those focused on respiratory infection often contained health worker training and education components. The impact of educational hygiene messages on behaviours such as handwashing and breastfeeding was assessed by Froozani et al. 1999, who introduced an educational programme promoting breastfeeding among Iranian mothers to lessen the risk of infant ingestion of contaminated water and Ahmed et al. 1993, who evaluate an intervention consisting of educational messages and household surveillance to improve hygiene practices. Several studies combined handwashing promotion along with instructions regarding animal and child faeces. For instance, Haggerty et al. 1994 assessed an intervention in Zaire today Democratic Republic of the Congo consisting of educational messages instructing the disposal of animal faeces, handwashing after defecation and before meal preparation and disposal of childrens faeces. Similarly, Stanton and Clemens 1987 observed a significant difference intervention groups after implementation of a hygiene education programme. the rate of diarrhea between control and in Bateman et al. 1995 measured the impact of two intervention models against diarrhoeal incidence: Model 1 was a more conventional model, based on courtyard education sessions with the tubewell caretakers, their spouses, and tubewell users. The secondmore innovativemodel adds additional outreach activities: school programmes, child to child activities, and activities with key influencers in the community. Outreach methodologies varied by target group, but included group discussion, demonstrations, participatory action learning exercises, flash card displays, folk songs, role playing, a comic story session, and games. Interventions focused on respiratory infection morbidity and mortality typically included a health worker training component in addition to health education for mothers. Examples include Lye et al. 1996, who implemented a training programme targeting health workers and mothers of children under the age of five, and Khan et al. 1990, who oversaw an intervention consisting of maternal education and health worker training components. Communitybased health workers were trained to recognize signs such as increased respiratory rate and chest retractions to detect pneumonia requiring treatment with antibiotics at home or referral to hospital. The programme also included efforts to educate mothers to recognize pneumonia and to provide appropriate supportive measures, and emphasized the importance of timely immunization and good nutrition. Fauveau et al. 1992 report on the impact of two successive interventions, the first consisting of a communitybased family planning and health services project and the second consisting of case detection and management by community health workers, backed by medical support. Other interventions aimed at behavioural change focused solely on the training of health workers Bang et al. 1994; Pandey et al. 1991. Nonclinical interventions are fundamental, and complementary to recent global and national efforts to scale up preventive and treatment clinical interventions such as vaccination campaigns and the distribution of oral rehydration salts and zinc supplements, and antibiotics see the righthand side of Figure 1. In this paper, we mostly focus on nonclinical interventions although both types of policies, i.e. clinical and nonclinical should be seen as an integral part of public health strategies to tackle preventable and treatable childhood 5 diseases and hence, decrease child mortality and morbidity in developing countries. In the following section we discuss the systematic review methodology adopted in this study. 3 Review methodology We conducted a systematic review based on the Cochrane review methodology in terms of selection criteria, searching strategy for the identification of studies, data extraction and data management. In the sections below, we briefly describe the review protocol. 3.1 Selection criteria Ecological, casecontrolled, retrospective cohort, nonblind randomized and nonrandomized quasiexperimental studies, including interrupted time series, were included. Studies were excluded on the following grounds: unclear methodologies andor samples, methodologies which involved mathematical modelling but lacked empirical analysis. The review focused in particular on children and child hospital cases in developing countries. Slightly different definitions of children were used during the search, as dictated by existing age categories in search databases. Studies which presented data on individual children aged five or younger were included. Other units of analysis, such as households or neighbourhoods in cluster trials, were also included if they presented data on children specifically. Policy interventions in the review included educational or training programmes regarding hygiene, sanitation, nutrition, and case management, and infrastructure enhancements regarding water quality and supply, latrine access, and the provision of hospital equipment. Selected studies described and evaluated one or more of the above interventions. The main outcome measures were childhood mortality and morbidity due to diarrhoeal and respiratory diseases, although studies frequently contained additional outcomes such as quality of treatment provided, admissions to hospital, and hygiene behaviours. 3.2 Search strategy for the identification of studies The following terms were included in an abstract search carried out through a number of databases and repositories of bibliographic resources that included Medline, Embase, Global Health, IBSS, and Econlit databases: No. 1 DEVELOP COUNTR OR LOW MIDDLE INCOME No. 22 MEASLES OR MORBILLI OR RUBEOLA OR POLIO OR INFANTILE PARALYSIS OR PNEUMON OR DIARRHOEA OR DIARRHEA OR ROTAVIRUS OR ESCHERICHIA COLI OR GASTROENTERITIS OR PERTUSSIS OR WHOOPING COUGH No. 3 CHILD OR ADOLESCEN OR TEEN OR YOUTH OR YOUNG No. 4 PROGRAM or PROJECT or VACCIN or POLICY or STRATEGY or INTERVENTION or IMMUNIZ or IMMUNIS or CAMPAIGN or REHYDRAT SOLUTION or ANTIBIOTIC or TREATMENT or MEDICAT or ZINC THERAP For searches in Medline, Embase, and Global Health, No. 1 was supplemented by a medical subject headings Me SH query which excluded all high income countries. Identical terms 6 were entered into the Web of Science database. However, these were topical searches rather than abstract searches, since the latter is not an available option in Web of Science. The resulting articles were refined by excluding editorials and biographies, and those set in developed countries. Where available, filters on age range, language, and document type were applied to exclude articles in languages other than English and those focused on adults. Following the database search, bibliographic lists of relevant studies were examined for additional references. 3.3 Data extraction and management Articles were transferred from each database into an Endnote file. Duplicates were downloaded into a separate file. An Endnote file containing 4,017 unique articles was generated, along with 1,935 duplicate articles. Of the 4,017, 3,752 were excluded for the following reasons: specific focus on adults or populations in highincome countries, no intervention or policy tested, andor not focused on a treatable childhood disease see Figure 2. The texts of 265 articles were reviewed, of which 246 were excluded due to not meeting inclusion criteria. Selection criteria included a description and evaluation of a nonclinical policy intervention, and a relevant outcome such as morbidity or mortality due to a treatable childhood disease. Published studies and grey literature were included in order to avoid publication bias. In cases of studies yielding two or more articles based on the same sample or intervention, the main or latest article was included and all secondary articles excluded. Nineteen articles were selected for inclusion, along with 21 articles yielded through a search of reference lists of included articles and relevant review papers. Thus, the final sample included 40 studies. The following data was extracted from each study: authors, title of paper, year of publication, years of data collection, type of intervention, country, methodology used, sample size, outcome measures, impact size, summary of main findings, and URL. Regarding diarrhoeal diseases, 31 studies met the inclusion criteria, whereas only seven studies met the inclusion criteria for acute respiratory infections. Of the 31 included studies for diarrhoea policy intervention, the majority n 20 were nonblind randomized control trials, four were cluster randomized control studies, two used quasiexperimental interrupted time series research designs, and the remaining five included a prospective casecontrol study, a concurrent cohort study, a crosssectional followup survey on a nonblind control trial, a casecontrol study, and a nonblind control trial. Of the seven studies on acute respiratory infection, four were cluster nonblind randomized control trials, with one also incorporating a quasiexperimental interrupted time series component as phase II of the main study. One study was a nonblind control trial which implemented two consecutive interventions. The remaining two studies followed a quasiexperimental interrupted time series design see Table A1 in the Appendix. A variety of sample unit types were observed among the studies. Units included individuals, motherchild pairs, diagnostic cases, households, and communities or neighbourhoods. Of those studies where the exact number of children could be ascertained, sample sizes varied from 51 children to 17,101 children younger than five years in the case of diarrhoeal diseases, whereas from 11,291 to 83,233 children under age five for studies looking at acute respiratory infections. 7 Out of the 31 studies analysing nonclinical policies against diarrhoeal diseases, 19 were set in Asia and the middle east, six in Africa, five in Latin America and one in two settings Latin America and Asia. Fifteen studies were set in rural areas, ten in urban, four in periurban, one in an unknown setting, and one in a refugee camp not described as either rural or urban. With regard to policy innovations against acute respiratory diseases, six out of seven studies were situated in Asia and the Middle East. The remaining study was set in Africa. Five were set in rural locations, and two did not report locality Duke et al. 2008; Lye et al. 1996. In the following section, we present a synthesis of the evidence, following the theory of changebased typology described in Section 2. Figure 2: Methodological steps and selection process 4,017 articles retrieved Full text review: 265 Excluded: 3,752 Did not meet eligibility criteria: 246 21 articles yielded via snowball technique Selected: 19 articles Final selection: 40 Source: Authors. 4 Synthesis of evidence This section presents a synthesis of the included articles, according to the theory of change model described in Section 2. The policy interventions are divided into two drivers of change: enhancing resourcesinfrastructure and promoting behavioural change. The majority of studies 28 described and assessed the efficacy of interventions primarily focused on enhancing resources or infrastructure, while 12 focused on interventions promoting behavioural change among child caregivers andor health workers. In the next sections we discuss the findings more thoroughly. 8 4.1 Interventions aimed at enhancing supplyside capabilities Studies classified as interventions aimed at enhancing supplied side capabilities of governments via resources andor infrastructure includes those improving water supply or quality, soap access, hospital equipment, or sanitation. Water quality interventions involve the removal of microbial contaminants, either at the source or at the household level. Such interventions were frequently paired with the provision of improved water storage vessels. For instance, Graf et al. 2010 assessed an intervention aimed to improve water quality through solar disinfection, while others focused on the provision of safe water storage containers Roberts et al. 2001, ceramic water filters and chlorine or other water disinfectants Semenza et al. 1998; Clasen et al. 2004; Jensen et al. 2003; Sobsey et al. 2003; Reller et al. 2003. Studies observing the effects of hospital enhancements were rare, with only one study examining the impact of oxygen concentrators and pulse oximeters in hospitals on morbidity of children with pneumonia Duke et al. 2008. The case fatality rate of the preintervention group was 4.97 per cent 95 per cent CI: 4.55.5 compared to the postintervention group rate of 3.22 per cent 95 per cent CI: 2.53.8. The risk of death for a child with pneumonia was 35 per cent lower than was before the equipment was implemented RR 0.65 0.520.78, p0.0001. Sanitation interventions were those that provided some means of excreta disposal, usually latrines. For instance, Daniels et al. 1990 assessed the impact of latrine ownership on diarrhoeal morbidity. They found that children from households with a latrine may experience 24 per cent fewer episodes of diarrhoea than such children from households without a latrine OR 0.76, 95 per cent CI 0.58 1.01, and the impact of latrines was greater in households that used more water, practiced better personal hygiene, and where mothers had a higher level of education or worked outside the home. Water supply interventions included the provision of a new or improved water supply, or improved distribution. Improved distribution included the installation of a hand pump or household connection to municipal water sources. One study assessed the impact of periurban access to a metropolitan sewerage system Kolahi et al. 2009, while another described a water improvement intervention involving the installation of a piped water network Tonglet et al., 1992. Semenza et al. 1998 compared diarrhoeal incidence between a group who had access to a piped municipal water system to a group without access, further dividing the latter into a control and intervention group Semenza et al. 1998. The intervention group received chlorination and safe water equipment. The diarrhoeal rates for children were as follows: 84.4 per 1,000 per month for those in households with piped water, 127.7 per 1,000 children per month in households without piped water and the intervention, and 42.2 per 1,000 children per month in children without piped water but received the intervention. The relative risk of diarrhea among children in the intervention rather than control no access to piped water, received no intervention was 0.33 95 per cent CI 0.190.57. The relative risk of children who received the intervention versus those who received piped water was 0.50 95 per cent CI 0.290.84. The relative risk of children in the control group versus those who received piped water was 1.5 95 per cent CI 1.052.13. Aziz et al. 1990 and Tonglet et al. 1992 each found that the success of water supply interventions which involve the provision of handpumps partially depends on proximity of households to the pumps. Aziz et al. 1990 found that diarrhoea incidence increased as distance from the household to the handpump increased. However, a followup study 9 completed approximately six years after the original revealed that the point prevalence of diarrhoeal morbidity was significantly lower among the population in the intervention area than that in the control area, which suggests health benefits at the community level overall Hoque et al., 1996. Six years after the intervention, children under the age of five living in the control area had a relative risk of diarrhoea of 2.25 compared to those in the intervention area, but the difference was not statistically significant. Tonglet et al. 1992 found that children living in villages with a piped water source experienced a significantly reduced incidence of diarrhoea compared to children in a control village, children in intervention villages who lived less than a five minute walk from the water source, and those in households which used more than 50 litres of water per day, experienced half the incidence of diarrhoea than that experienced by other children in the intervention village. These findings demonstrate the impact of relative accessibility within communities with improved water supply facilities. Studies which explored differences within their intervention groups, or contained two intervention groups, add nuance to these findings Azurin and Alvero 1974; Nanan et al. 2003; Aziz et al. 1990; Bateman et al. 1995. For instance, Azurin and Alvero 1974 found that the rate of incidence measured by rate per 1,000 was markedly less in the intervention group which received both improved waste disposal and improved water supply 193 per 1,000 than intervention groups which received only improved water supply or only improved waste disposal 213.7 and 321.1 per 1,000 respectively, and a control group which received neither provision 542.2 per 1,000. A number of multipronged interventions were identified, which supplemented resource improvements with an educational component targeting child caregivers typically mothers Garrett et al. 2008; Azurin and Alvero 1974; Nanan et al. 2003; Aziz et al. 1990; Hoque et al. 1996; Quick et al. 1999; Khan 1982; Alam et al. 1989. For instance, Han and Hlaing 1989 provided mothers and children with soap and instructions to wash their hands after defecation and before handling and eating their three main meals per day. The intervention yielded a 30 per cent reduction of diarrhoeal incidence among 04 year olds, 31 per cent among those younger than two, and 33 per cent among those aged two or older. A more extensive intervention assessed by Alam et al. 1989 introduced an augmented water supply through handpumps, as well as health education for mother to an intervention group. Results show that, in both areas, use of handpump water for drinking and washing, removal of childs faeces from the yard, and maternal handwashing before handling food and after defecation of self and child, observed together, decreased yearly diarrhoea incidence in children by more than 40 per cent compared to children living in households where none or only one of these practices was observed. Finally, the Rural Sanitation Pilot Project RSPP assessed by Daniels et al. 1990 found that children from households with a latrine may experience 24 per cent fewer episodes of diarrhoea than such children from households without a latrine OR 0.76, 95 per cent CI 0.58 1.01, and the impact of latrines was greater in households that used more water, had better personal hygiene, and where mothers had a higher level of education or worked outside the home. Particularly extensive interventions are assessed by Lockwood et al. 2001; Quick et al. 1999; Rana 2009; Shahid et al. 1996; Nanan et al. 2003; Luby et al. 2006; and Luby et al. 2004. The latter authors found that infants living in households that received handwashing promotion and plain soap had 39 per cent fewer days with diarrhoea versus infants living in control neighbourhoods, and severely malnourished children younger than 10 five years living in households that received handwashing promotion and plain soap had 42 per cent fewer days with diarrhoea versus severely malnourished children in the control group. Luby et al. 2006 evaluated an intervention in which households received one of the following: diluted bleach and a water vessel, soap and handwashing promotion messages, flocculentdisinfectant water treatment and a water vessel, disinfectant water treatment and soap and handwashing promotion, or no in neighbourhoods that received any of the interventions had markedly less diarrhoea compared to persons living in control neighbourhoods. Diarrhoea prevalence was consistently lower among infants and children aged 12 years who lived in intervention neighbourhoods compared to control neighbourhoods. However, the differences in prevalence were not statistically significant and yielded extremely large confidence intervals. intervention. Overall, persons living The impact of the Water and Sanitation Extension Programme WASEP project, aimed at improving potable water supply, sanitation facilities, and awareness and practices about hygiene behaviour, was assessed by Nanan et al. 2003. They found that children in control villages had a 33 per cent higher adjusted odds ratio for having diarrhoea than children living in intervention villages adjusted odds ratio, 1.331; p0.049. Within their intervention group, boys had 25 per cent lower odds of having diarrhoea than girls adjusted odds ratio, 0.748; p0.049. Lockwood et al. 2001 provide an evaluation of the Nicaragua Rural Water Supply, Sanitation, and Environmental Health Programme. The programme took an integrated approach to improving health and addressed three key areas: 1 water supply and sanitation infrastructure improving peoples access to safe sources of drinking water and excreta disposal facilities; 2 hygiene promotion promoting knowledge about hygiene and achieving sustainable changes in key highrisk behaviours to reduce the incidence of diarrhoea among the beneficiary population; and 3 enabling environment conducting capacitybuilding interventions to support project sustainability at community, institutional, and national levels. The programme was associated with a 7 per cent decrease in households reporting childhood diarrhoea between the baseline and final followup survey. Another largescale project was assessed by Quick et al. 1999. The intervention was comprised of three elements: pointofuse treatment of contaminated source water with disinfectant produced locally using appropriate technology, safe storage of treated water, and community education. Households in the intervention area had 44 per cent fewer diarrhoea episodes than those in the control area p 0.002, with significantly less diarrhoea among infants less than one year old and children aged 514 years in the former compared to the latter p 0.05 and 0.01 respectively. In intervention areas, diarrhoea incidence was reduced 53 per cent among infants and 59 per cent among children 514. Rana 2009 assesses a combined sanitation, hygiene, education, and water supply intervention in Bangladesh. The intervention package included promotional activities for installation of sanitary latrines and tube wells, along with health education. The education component was particularly extensive, promoting the following behaviours: washing hands with soap, ash, or soil after defecation, washing hands with soap before eating and before serving food to the household members and children, using safe water for cooking, washing and bathing, keeping surroundings of the households, kitchen, tube wells and latrines tidy, constructing a platform for tube wells with solid materials, disposing of domestic waste, excreta of poultry and livestock in fixed place and disposal of children faeces in sanitary 11 latrine, and preserving foods with appropriate cover. A significant reduction in point prevalence of waterborne diseases including diarrhoea, dysentery, jaundice, worm infections and typhoid fever among underfive children was observed following the intervention, from 22 per cent to 13 per cent p0.001. Rasella et al. 2010 reported outcomes associated with The Family Health Programme FHP strategy, which reorganized primary health care in Brazil. The outcome was mortality of children younger than five years, particularly due to diarrhoeal diseases and lower respiratory tract infections. Mortality rates due to diarrhoeal diseases for children younger than five years decreased from 0.81 to 0.46 per 1,000 live births a 43 per cent reduction, as did mortality from lower respiratory infections from 1.39 to 0.96 per 1,000 live births, a 31 per cent reduction. Reductions of 31 per cent 95 per cent CI: 20 per cent40 per cent and 19 per cent 95 per cent CI: 8 per cent28 per cent in mortality rates due to diarrhoeal diseases and lower respiratory infections respectively were observed in municipalities with the highest FHP coverage. Though most studies described above found improved outcomes associated with an intervention, a few did not. For instance, Jensen et al. 2003 found that the incidence of diarrhoea among children in their intervention village which received water through a chlorinated water supply scheme did not differ statistically from a neighbouring village where most children used water from a nonchlorinated water supply. Luby et al. 2006 found that children in intervention areas experienced a reduced incidence of diarrhea than those in the control area, but this difference was not statistically significant. In their intervention which corralled freerange chickens, Oberhelman et al. 2006 found a higher rate of diarrhoea in children in their intervention than control group. Mixed findings were obtained by Reller et al. 2003, who found that their intervention group which received a disinfectant for drinking water plus a storage vessel was the only group to experience a significant decline in diarrhoeal episodes among children aged one or younger. Other intervention groups, including those who received water disinfectant only, bleach only, or bleach plus a storage vessel did not experience a significant reduction of diarrhoeal episodes among children compared to the control group. However, these findings are of questionable validity due to low compliance among the intervention groups. Some studies obtained divergent findings based on age. In their evaluation of an intervention which promoted handwashing through the provision of soap and education, Sircar et al. 1987 observed no difference in the rates of diarrhoea or dysentery among those younger than five years of age. However, rates of dysentery were lower in the intervention group among those aged five and older. Conversely, Han and Hlaing 1989 found that their intervention which instructed mothers and children to wash their hands after defecation and before handling and eating their three main meals per day had no impact on dysentery rates among older children. Luby et al. 2006 found that their multifaceted intervention had a much greater impact among the 515 yearold age group than among young children and infants. Quick et al. 1999 found that infants aged less than one year experienced a 53 per cent reduction in diarrhoeal episodes than their control group counterparts, yet no significant effect was observed for children aged one through four years. Diarrhoea incidence was reduced 61 per cent among those aged 011 months, 47 per cent among those aged 1223 months, and 56 per cent among those aged 2459 months in an intervention involving handwashing promotion and education assessed by Shahid et al. 1996. 12 4.2 Interventions promoting behavioural change The promotion of behavioural change represents another major driver of change. Interventions focused on diarrhoealrelated morbidity andor mortality are commonly aimed mothers of young children, while those focused on respiratory infection often contained health worker training and education components. Haggerty et al. 1994 assessed an intervention targeted at diarrhoeal incidence, which featured educational messages instructing the disposal of animal faeces, handwashing after defecation and before meal preparation and disposal of childrens faeces. A followup survey revealed an 11 per cent reduction in reported diarrhoea among children in the intervention group, compared to controls p0.025. Stanton and Clemens 1987 similarly observed a significant difference between control and intervention groups after implementation of a hygiene education programme. The rate of diarrhoea in children under the age of five was 4.3 versus 5.8 per 100 in the intervention group and control groups respectively, yielding a protective efficacy of 26 per cent p0.0001. A particularly extensive intervention is provided by Bateman et al. 1995, in their assessment of two intervention models: Model 1 was based on education sessions with the tubewell caretakers, their spouses, and tubewell users, while Model 2 added additional outreach activities: school programmes, child to child activities, and activities with key community members. They found that while caretaker sessions alone Model 1 are worthwhile and have important benefits, Model 2 with multiple channels of communication was a better intervention. The dramatic differences between intervention and control areas, together with the smaller differences between the two intervention areas, suggests that the key elements of a successful hygiene behaviour change programme may be those that are similar in both models. The programme resulted in a twothird reduction of diarrhoea in the intervention areas versus control. Bang et al. 1994 observed a 44 per cent decline p0.01 in the neonatal mortality rate due to pneumonia following the implementation of a training programme for paramedical workers, village health workers, and traditional birth attendants. Similarly, a training programme implemented by Pandey et al. 1991 led to a 28 per cent reduction in the risk of death from all causes by the third year of implementation relative risk: 0.72, 95 per cent CI: 0.630.82. Reductions were observed not only in deaths due to pneumonia, but also to diarrhoea and measles. Lye et al. 1996 implemented a training programme targeting mothers of children under the age of five in addition to health staff. The reduction in the incidence of severe acute respiratory infection cases over a 62 week period in the intervention area was significantly greater than in the control area p0.05. In a similar vein, Mtango and Neuvians 1986 implemented a health service outreach programme featuring regular home visits by health workers aimed at educating mothers and providing treatment to sick children. Within a twoyear period the total underfive mortality was reduced by 27.2 per cent from 40.1 to 29.2 per 1,000 children. A maternal education and health worker training intervention was assessed by Khan et al. 1990. Communitybased health workers were trained to recognize signs of pneumonia, and differentiate between cases requiring treatment with antibiotics at home or referral to hospital. After the programme was implemented, the Acute Lower Respiratory Infection ALRIspecific mortality rate among children 5 years old in 31 intervention villages was 13 6.3 deaths per 1,000 children per year, compared with 14.4 in seven control villages p 0.0001, a difference of 56 per cent. Within one year of the interventions being extended to the control villages, the ALRI specific mortality rate in these villages dropped by 55 per cent to 6.5 per 1,000 children per year p 0.06. A dualpronged intervention was also assessed by Fauveau et al. 1992. They report on the impact of two successive interventions, the first consisting of a communitybased family planning and health services project and the second consisting of case detection and management by community health workers, backed by medical support. During the first phase 198687, the ALRI mortality among under5yearolds was 28 per cent lower in the intervention than in the comparison area p0.01. During the second phase 198889, the ALRIspecific mortality rate among under5yearolds was 48 per cent lower in the intervention than in the comparison area p0.001. The ALRI mortality was 32 per cent lower in the intervention area than during the preceding phase, while there was no significant difference for the comparison area. English et al. 1997 implemented a nutrition improvement programme and observed the impact on child morbidity due to respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases. The intervention group showed a significant reduction p0.00001 in the incidence of respiratory infections from 49.5 per cent to 11.2 per cent and diarrhoeal infections 18.3 per cent to 5.1 per cent, as well as reduced incidence of pneumonia and severe pneumonia p0.0001. There was no significant change in the incidence and severity of respiratory or diarrhoeal disease in the control group. Froozani et al. 1999 assessed an educational programme promoting breastfeeding among new mothers in Iran, as a method of lessening the risk of infant ingestion of contaminated water. The mean number of days of diarrhoea among infants in the intervention group was significantly lower p 0.004 than in the control group. Ambiguous results were obtained by Ahmed et al. 1993. Though children in their intervention group experienced fewer episodes of diarrhoeal than their controlgroup counterparts during the wet season in Bangladesh, rates were similar before and after the wet season. Moreover, significant differences between the control and intervention areas at baseline, along with a lack of significance testing, weaken the validity of these results. 5 Conclusion and policy implications The evidence support the assumption that enhancing resources andor infrastructure, and promoting behavioural change, are effective in reducing child morbidity and mortality due to diarrhoeal disease and acute respiratory infections in developing countries. Interventions targeting diarrhoeal incidence generally demonstrated a reduction, ranging from 18.3 per cent Roberts et al. 2001 to 61 per cent Rana 2009. This wide range of impact seems to reflect the diverse types of interventions tested, along with the diverse settings in which these interventions have been implemented. The findings regarding the impact of water sanitation initiatives is wellsupported by previous reviews, albeit focused on general populations rather than on children in developing countries Esrey et al. 1985; Esrey et al. 1991. This review identified a number of studies, especially those concerned with reducing diarrhoeal disease, which feature a multifaceted approach for instance, a sanitation initiative coupled with water quality improvement measures. Though there is some evidence to 14 suggest that interventions which include several aspects yield more successful outcomes than singlepronged interventions EPH et al. 2004; Azurin and Alvero 1974; Bateman et al. 1995; Reller et al. 2003, a recent systematic review and metaanalysis on interventions to reduce diarrhoea among all age groups concluded that multiple interventions were not more effective than interventions with a single focus Fewtrell et al., 2005. Additional agedisaggregated research may clarify whether multifaceted are more effective than singlefocus interventions, as applied to samples consisting of young children. Several interventions proved more or less effective according to age. Whilst some studies showed greater impacts among infants and very young children Quick et al. 1999 , others demonstrated a greater effect for older children Aziz et al. 1990; Sircar et al. 1987; Luby et al. 2006. One study showed a Ushaped impact, with infants and children aged 25 benefitting more than those aged 12 Shahid et al. 1996. Another found a strong relationship between the intervention and age category for dysentery, yet not for nondysentery diarrhoea Han and Hlaing 1989. Some interventions, including sanitation promotion among households, may have a greater protective impact for infants since they may come into more frequent contact with surfaces including faecescontaminated floors in and around dwellings than adults and older children. Infants and very young children also rely on others to wash their hands for them, which certainly influences the efficacy of handwashing promotion interventions. Further research to determine the impact of intervention type by age is justified. Though almost half of deaths globally among young children occur in India, Nigeria, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Pakistan, and China Black et al. 2010, only a third of the articles in this review were based in one of these countries. Pakistan was fairly well represented, as the setting of five articles Jensen et al. 2003; Khan et al. 1990; Luby et al. 2006; Luby et al. 2004; Nanan et al. 2003. Two studies each were set in India Bang et al. 1994; Sircar et al. 1987 and Zaire Tonglet et al. 1992; Haggerty et al. 1994. However, there were no studies set in Nigeria or China. As articles in languages other than English were excluded, we may have missed out in the review some evidence. However, given the fact that most relevant studies have been published in English, we believe the magnitude of the bias is contained. The results of this review show a relative dearth of intervention studies on respiratory infections, compared to those on diarrhoeal diseases: while over 30 studies were identified on diarrhoea diseases, only seven were identified for respiratory infections. This seems to reflect the fact that the bulk of intervention studies on respiratory infections as focused on clinical interventions such as vaccines and antibiotics. The near absence of studies on nonclinical interventions, including handwashing initiatives, on reducing respiratory infections is surprising considering the effectiveness of handwashing initiatives on respiratory infections in other settings Rabie and Curtis 2006. This review has identified 40 articles on nonclinical interventions for diarrhoeal diseases and respiratory infections, which together kill approximately three million children in developing countries every year Black et al. 2010. Investments in implementing initiatives featuring improvements to sanitation, hygiene, water supply and quality, and medical equipment to detect symptoms of childhood diseases, along with training and education for medical workers and the general population have been shown to be effective in reducing the burden of disease among children in developing countries. 15 Greater attention is warranted in understudied areas with high disease burdens including Nigeria, China, India, and Democratic Republic of the Congo. There are comparatively few studies assessing the impact of nonclinical interventions on respiratory infections, compared to those focusing on diarrhoeal disease. Future studies should continue to disaggregate their results based on age, since many interventions have different impacts depending on the age of the child. 16 Appendix Table A1: Study characteristics of included articles Study Setting Study design Study size Intervention Outcome a Enhancing resources andor infrastructure Alam et al. 1989Bangladesh rural Nonblind RCT623 children aged 623 months. quality Enhanced water supply and through handpumps, and health education for mothers.

The sample of children ranged from a low of 6,922 to a high of 8,527 to 1987 from 1984 respectively in the intervention group, and from a low of 6,603 to a high of 8,210 from 1984 to 1985 respectively in the control group. 17 The use of handpump water for drinking and washing, removal of childs faeces from the yard, and maternal handwashing before handling food and after defecation of self and child, observed together, decreased yearly diarrhoea incidence in children by more than 40 per cent compared to children living in households where none or only one of these practices was observed. On average, a child in the intervention area had 3.4 diarrhoea episodes in a year while a child in the control area had 4.1 episodes. The difference was statistically significant p0.01. The impact of the educational intervention on maternal hygiene behaviour could be assessed only indirectly by comparing distributions of hygiene practices in two areas. Significant differences have been found X2 113.3, p0.001 which may indicate success of the health education programme in promoting hygiene among the noneducated mothers of young children. Children in the intervention area experienced 25 per cent fewer episodes of diarrhoea than those in the control area. An impact on diarrhoea was seen in each age group except for those aged 05 months. The incidence density ratios showed that the impact appeared to increase with age, with the greatest effect in the 3659 months age group. Within the intervention area diarrhoea increased as distance from the household to the handpump increased. The use of a pit latrine, either directly by the child or for disposal of its faeces, was associated with lower diarrhoea incidence. Improvement of either water supply or toilet facilities or both was effective in significantly reducing the incidence of cholera in the corresponding study communities as compared with the control. The greatest the community in which both water supply and toilets were improved than in the communities in which either water or toilets were improved. The rate of cholera infection among those aged 04 was 193.1 per 1,000 in the group which received toilets and water, 213.7 per 1,000 in the group which received improved water, 321.1 per 1,000 in the group which received toilets, and 542.2 per 1,000 in the group which received no intervention. improvement was observed in Azurin and Alvero 1974 Philippines urban periNonblind RCT527 children aged 04.Safe water and sanitary facilities human for waste disposal. 18 Clasen et al. 2004Bolivia rural Nonblind RCThouseholds 50 comprised 280 of persons, of which 32 were children less than five years of age.

Lye et al. 1996Malaysia unspecified Nonblind RCTMtango Neuvians 1986 and Tanzania rural Cluster nonblind RCT An intervention sample of n 1,315 to 1,458 and a control sample of 1,042 to 1,205 children under the age of five. 8,028 and 0,099 children in the intervention area and 8,098 and 9,915 in the control area in the 29 sites had a reported mean of 0.85 episodes of diarrhoea, while children in control sites had 0.90 episodes NS. There was no discernible evidence of a trend towards fewer episodes of diarrhoea in intervention compared to control children after the intervention. Nevertheless, proportionately fewer children in intervention sites were reported to have diarrhoea than at control sites. The ALRIspecific mortality rate among children 5 years old in intervention villages was 6.3 deaths per 1,000 children per year, compared with 14.4 in seven control villages p 0.0001, a difference of 56 per cent. Within one year of the interventions being extended to the control villages, the ALRI specific mortality rate in these villages dropped by 55 per cent to 6.5 per 1,000 children per year p 0.06. The ALRIspecific infant less than one year old mortality rate in the intervention villages was 15.5 per 1,000 live births per year in 198586, compared with 32.5 per 1,000 per year in the control villages, a 52 per cent difference p 0.006. After interventions began in the control villages in 1987, the ALRIspecific infant mortality rate dropped to 15.0 per 1,000 per year p 0.12.

The diseasespecific mortality rate for pneumonia was reduced by 30.1 per cent from 14.3 to 10.0 per 1,000 children per year, contributing 40 per cent to the overall mortality reduction. The programme led to a 28 per cent reduction in the risk of death from all causes by the third year since implementation relative risk: 0.72, 95 per cent CI: 0.630.82.
