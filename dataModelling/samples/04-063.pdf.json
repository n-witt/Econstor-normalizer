The Nash equilibrium of this gameexhibits the following properties: i an equilibrium where workers apply for just one job exhibitsunemployment and absence of wage dispersion; ii an equilibrium where workers apply for twoor for more but not for all jobs always exhibits wage dispersion and, typically, unemployment;iii the equilibrium wage distribution with a higher vacancytounemployment ratio firstorderstochastically dominates the wage distribution with a lower level of labor market tightness; ivthe average wage is nonmonotonic in the number of applications; v the equilibrium numberof applications is nonmonotonic in the vacancytounemployment ratio; vi a minimum wageincrease can be welfare improving because it compresses the wage distribution and reduces thecongestion effects caused by the socially excessive number of applications; and vii the only wayto obtain efficiency is to impose a mandatory wage that eliminates wage dispersion altogether.We have benefited from discussions with Jim Albrecht, Ken Burdett, Pierre Cahuc, Melvyn Coles, Andrea Galeotti, Rob van der Noll, Misja Nuyens, Vladimir Karamychev, Zsolt Sandor, Otto Swank, Susan Vroman andparticipants at the IZA workshop on search and matching models.Department of Economics, Erasmus University Rotterdam, Burg.

Most of the posted vacancies give a detailedjob description but show no wage information. At the academic job market, candidates often sendout more than 50 applications simultaneously without knowing precisely the wages they will bepaid. The focus of this paper is on the features and efficiency properties of markets with the abovecharacteristics. We present a model in which firms set wages, and workers apply to one or morejobs simultaneously. The number of applications a worker sends out when looking for a job andthe wages that the firms set are endogenously determined in equilibrium.1 We are interested in theexistence and the properties of Nash equilibria in this game.In our model, the exogenous variables are: the relative size of the labor force, workers application cost and the number of candidates that a firm can consider. Conditional on those variables wederive the number of matches, the wage distribution and the unemployment rate. The model has anumber of novel features. First, the arrival rate of job offers is endogenous and sensitive to key labormarket parameters such as the vacancytounemployment ratio and the minimum wage. Secondly,we explicitly model the extent of congestion effects caused by the intensity of job search. This hasimportant implications for the desirability of minimum wage increases or mandatory wages thateliminate wage dispersion altogether. Usually, search intensity is treated as a technology parameterPissarides, 2000, that increases the match probability for a worker. For the aggregate number ofmatches it does not matter whether the number of workers or the search intensity is doubled. In ourmodel, a higher search intensity leads to more coordination problems between firms, as in Albrechtet al. 2004, and may thus lead to fewer matches; this may help explain the finding of Kuhn and Skuterud 2004 that Internet search does not reduce unemployment duration. Furthermore, sinceworkers who receive multiple offers pick the job with the highest wage, wage dispersion increasesthe individual incentives to apply. In this respect our model differs from Shimer 2004. However,workers do not internalize the congestion effects of their applications and therefore, the equilibriumis not constrained efficient.We study a market with v 1 vacancies and u 2 unemployed workers. We consider recruitment technologies Rm where a firm offers the job to a first candidate picked at random if it has 1 The model is therefore not subject to the partialpartial critique of Rothschild 1973.2any and if it fails to hire her it offers the job to the next candidate if present and so on and soforth till its m th candidate if present. We focus on the two extreme cases of this recruitmenttechnology. First, R1, the one explored in Albrecht et al. 2003, where firms with candidates pickone worker at random, offer the job to her and the market closes. In the other extreme, Ru, wherefirms that fail to hire their first candidate can offer the job to their second candidate, and so ontill the very last applicant they have. Workers who receive multiple offers take the one with thehighest wage.Depending on the cost involved in completing an application and on the minimum wage, theremay be equilibria where workers either apply to just one job or apply to several jobs. When workersapply to just one job we get the standard Diamond 1971 result that the wage distribution isdegenerate at the minimum wage. This follows from the fact that a firm only has an incentive tooffer higher wages than other firms if this increases the hiring probability, but this cannot happenwhen all workers apply to just one job. We find that this type of result can only be sustained when,for a given level of the minimum wage, application costs are neither too high, which prevents workerparticipation, nor too low, which gives a worker incentives to deviate by applying to multiple jobsin order to increase her hiring probability. This contrasts with for example Acemoglu and Shimer2000, where a monopsony equilibrium exists always.When application cost are low, workers send multiple applications and the equilibrium is characterized by wage dispersion. The nature of the wage dispersion is similar to Burdett and Judd1983, Lang 1991 and Acemoglu and Shimer 2000 where some workers observe more than onewage while others sample just one. In our model, some workers receive one offer and others receivetwo or more. In Burdett and Mortensen 1998, by contrast, wage dispersion arises because a firmswage offer may arrive either at an employed worker who are choosier or at an unemployed worker,while in Albrecht and Axell 1984 it arises because workers have different reservation wages.We now briefly discuss the unemployment features of the labor market equilibria. Recruitmenttechnologies other than Ru naturally lead to unemployment simply because workers cannot coordinate where they send their applications. But even under recruitment technology Ru, the mostlikely outcome is unemployment because the absence of it requires that workers apply to as manyjobs as there are workers, which is unlikely to occur in large markets with costly applications.Some of the mechanisms that are at work in our model are illustrated by a simple 3 worker3 firmeconomy. In this context, we discuss the difference between the recruitment technologies R1 and 3R3. We find that the equilibrium characteristics are to a large extent invariant to the recruitmenttechnology. The example also illustrates that individual incentives often lead to inefficient outcomesand that a minimum wage can be used to align the private and the social incentives.In thefinal part of the paper we examine large labor markets and we focus on R1 because that allowsus to solve the model for large u and v. This gets extremely tedious under other recruitmentmechanisms and the insights are similar as shown in the 3x 3 market.In this context, we firstexplore the relationship between the equilibrium wage distribution and labor market tightness onthe one hand, and the number of applications on the other hand. We find that, for a given numberof applications, the equilibrium wage distribution with a higher vacancytounemployment ratiofirstorder stochastically dominates the wage distribution with a lower labor market tightness. Bycontrast, a result in terms of firstorder stochastic dominance cannot be established when comparingfirm equilibria for different numbers of applications. We find that the average wage is nonmonotonicfirst increasing and then decreasing in the number of applications. This is due to two facts thataffect firm competitiveness in opposite directions: more applications increase the maximum numberof offers a worker can receive but reduce the probability that a particular application leads to anoffer.Secondly, we explore how the equilibrium number of applications relates to labor market tightness. We find again a nonmonotonic relationship. If the vacancytounemployment ratio is initially small and it increases, then workers respond by sending more applications in equilibrium.By contrast, if the market tightness parameter is large to start with, an increase in the vacancytounemployment ratio leads to fewer applications. The intuition for this result comes from theincentives workers have to send out applications. On the one hand, more applications increase thechance to get at least one job offer. On the other hand, more applications increase the expectedmaximum wage offer. When the vacancytounemployment ratio is very small, the wage distribution is skewed towards the minimum wage. As the vuratio goes up, wages increase and workersmarginal gains to apply rise. When the vacancytounemployment rate is large, the wage distribution is compressed in the neighborhood of the competitive wage and then the marginal gains toapply fall as the vacancytounemployment rate increases further.We then study the relationship between the equilibrium number of applications and the minimum wage. Again, the way the minimum wage affects workers incentives to send out applicationshinges upon labor market tightness: when there are few many firms per worker, an increase in the 4minimum wage leads to more less applications. The intuition for this result is related to the factthat the wage distribution and the minimum wage keep a monotonic relationship so, for example,when the wage distribution is already quite skewed towards the competitive wage, an increase inthe minimum wage reduces workers incentives to apply. This motivates the question whether theminimum wage can be a useful policy instrument to enhance efficiency in our labor market.To pursue this line of inquiry, we turn to examine whether private incentives lead to aggregateefficiency. We first observe that, irrespective of the level of the minimum wage, the number ofapplications workers send in equilibrium is excessive from a social welfare perspective. The ideahere is that an individual worker does not internalize the effects that hisher applications causeon the other workers. This result contrasts with Acemoglu and Shimer 2000, where there is toolittle search in equilibrium because some workers freeride on the search of others. The differencein results arises due to the additional motives workers have to send out applications in our setting:higher search intensity increases not only the expected wage but also the hiring probability. It thenfollows that an increase in the minimum wage is desirable if the vacancytounemployment ratio isrelatively large because in that case the equilibrium number of applications is reduced and welfarerises. This mechanism is new to our knowledge. When there is already a lot of competition forworkers, extra applications are not desirable. Introducing a minimum wage reduces the number ofapplications by compressing the wage distribution and this can increase employment by reducingcoordination frictions. By contrast, if the number of vacancies is small relative to the numberof workers, then a minimum wage increase gives workers incentives to send more applications inequilibrium, which worsens the situation. We show that constrained efficiency can be achievedin our setting by imposing a particular mandatory wage that eliminates wage dispersion altogetherand consequently one of the motives workers have to send applications.The last issue we examine is how our equilibrium is affected by free entry of vacancies. We firstexplore the relationship between firms incentives to enter the economy and the minimum wage fora given number of applications. Not surprisingly, we find that entry incentives are monotonicallydecreasing in the minimum wage. Secondly, we explore how firm entry is affected by the numberof applications workers send out. We find that firms incentives to enter are nonmonotonic firstdecreasing then increasing in the number of applications. Thirdly, we find that, from the pointof view of social welfare, entry is excessive if the minimum wage is low, while it is insufficientif the minimum wage is large. Finally, we look at how the minimum wage affects the freeentry 5equilibrium with an endogenous number of applications. Since the equilibrium conditions for labormarket tightness and the number of applications are highly nonlinear, the longrun implicationof changes in the minimum wage are highly sensitive to the markets initial conditions.In thelongrun equilibrium, an increase in the minimum wage always leads to exit and, if initially thereare sufficiently many firms in the market, to more applications, otherwise to fewer applications.Our analysis is further related to the consumer search models of Burdett and Judd 1983 and Janssen and MoragaGonzalez 2004. The fundamental difference between those models and ourlabor market model is that here vacancies can only be occupied by a single worker whereas in thegoods market, rationing is usually less important. Workers anticipate the labor market frictionsthat arise from rationing and send an excessive amount of applications, which in turn may amplifythe extent of the frictions.The nature of unemployment in our model is similar to the directed search models of Montgomery 1991, Burdett, Shi, Wright 2001 and Albrecht et al. 2003. When workers apply to onejob only, some vacancies receive multiple applications while others receive none. Accordingly, someworkers receive no offers and remain unemployed while others receive multiple offers. Albrecht et al.2003 show that when workers apply to multiple jobs, this coordination failure does not disappearbut becomes less important. Our work is important in this sense because workers do not only takeinto account the magnitude of these frictions but also the wage they expect to get when they decideupon the number of applications to send out. Another difference is that in our model, search israndom, capturing the idea that there are characteristics about the job that the worker only findsout after the firm has been contacted.2 This generates atomless wage distributions in equilibriumwhile they derive twopoint distributions. Whether search is random or directed is ultimately anempirical question. However casual evidence shows that some job advertisements do post a wageand, as in the example above, some dont.The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the basic game. In section 3 we providesome properties of the equilibria. In section 4 we fully solve a 3x 3 example for both R1 and R3. Thissimple example captures the main mechanisms that are at work and shows that different recruitingtechnologies lead to similar insights. Section 5 discusses a number of general results for large labormarkets and some policy implications. Finally, section 6 concludes.2 For example, even though assistant professors may have some idea about the starting salaries at different universities, the amount of effort they have to put in the job depends on the teaching load, types of courses that must betaught, management duties, etc., which typically are revealed after the contact has taken place.62 The labor market We consider a single period labor market model with u 2 risk neutral unemployed workers andv 1 risk neutral vacancies. Firms, indexed by the subscript i, post wages. We assume that eachfirm has exactly one vacancy. A strategy for firm i is a wage offer, denoted Fiw. Wages must beposted above the minimum wage, denoted w; this enables us to study the effects of minimum wagepolicies.3 When a worker is matched with a vacancy they produce one unit of output.Workers, indexed by the subscript j, who manage to get a job receive a gross utility equal tothe wage w they are paid. To be able to receive wage offers, workers must send applications to thevacancies and complete the recruitment procedures. A typical worker knows the location of firmsbut she only learns about the wage of a firm after she has applied there and her application resultsin a wage offer. Applying to a job is costly. We assume that it costs a worker k 0 to complete andsubmit an application. Let a denote the number of applications that a worker sends to differentvacancies. A strategy for a worker j is the number of applications to send out: aj 1, 2,  , v.4If a worker receives two or more wage offers, she chooses the vacancy that offers the highest wage.Workers and firms play a simultaneous move game. A firm chooses a wage offer taking as giventhe wage offers of the rest of the firms as well as the number of applications sent by the workers. Aworker decides how many applications to send taking as given the wages offered by the firms as wellas the number of applications sent by the other workers. Once applications and wages have beendecided upon, a firm obtaining multiple applications randomly picks a candidate and offers the jobto her. If the candidate has no better offers, she accepts it while if she has better offers she rejectsit. Whether the firm can in the latter case go to its next candidates depends on the degree ofmarket frictions. To capture this idea we assume the following mechanism for the recruitment ofworkers:Definition 1 Let Rm be a recruitment technology. Under Rm, a firm that fails to hire its first 3 Alternatively, nothing is lost when w is interpreted as unemployment income. Then, wages must be quoted abovew to attract workers, and changes in w enable us to examine the implications of unemployment benefits.4 We are limiting the workers strategy set in the sense that a worker cannot address her applications to particularvacancies. The implication of this assumption is that if a worker sends a applications, the probability that a randomlyselected vacancy gets an application from the worker in question is av. Since we focus on symmetric equilibria whereidentical workers use the same strategies, this is not restrictive. Equilibria where, say, worker 1 applies with probabilityone to firm A and worker 2 with probability 1 to firm B etc. are not so interesting because they require a lot ofcoordination, which is difficult to achieve, in particular when the labor market is large. Furthermore, we assume thatworkers play pure strategies in terms of the number of applications they send out.7candidate if any can make an offer to its second candidate if any, and so on till its m thcandidate if any, m 1, 2, 3,  , u.In Albrecht et al. 2003, 2004 it is assumed that screening a worker takes one period. Thisrecruitment technology, labelled R1, captures a situation where frictions are quite large so that afirm that fails to hire its first candidate closes its vacancy. The other extreme case is a situationwhere screening is costless so that a firm that fails to hire its first candidate can always go backto the next candidates. We label this screening technology, Ru because the maximum numberof candidates a firm may have is u. The hiring procedure under Ru stops when all firms withapplicants have hired a worker that did not get hired by some other firm. Obviously, in marketswith relatively high frictions R1 makes more sense that Ru, while the opposite holds true in marketswith no frictions. Even though in general we expect intermediate technologies R2,  , Ru 1 to bein place in real world markets, we focus on the two extreme cases R1 and Ru in the remainderof the paper. One of the results we obtain is that these different recruitment technologies leadto similar qualitative results, so one would expect the same economic tradeoffs to appear for theother screening technologies.We focus on symmetric Nash equilibria of the game we described above. Asymmetric equilibriawill in general exist but are not so interesting in large labor markets because they require a lot ofcoordination of the agents.3 Equilibria Our first result characterizes the number of applications a that can be part of an equilibrium fordifferent recruitment technologies.Lemma 1 Under Ru, only a minu, v can be part of an equilibrium, while under Rm all a vcan be part of an equilibrium, m 1, 2, 3,  , u 1.Proof. Consider Ru. Assume first that minu, v v. Since workers do not send multiple applications to the same firm it trivially follows that a v. Assume now that minu, v u. We nowprove that a u cannot be part of an equilibrium. Suppose, on the contrary that a u 1. Inthat case all the workers as a collective would be in contact with a number of vacancies equal toor greater than u 1. Then, it is readily seen that firms wage setting must be competitive, i.e.,wi 1, i 1, 2,  , v. But then any worker would gain by reducing the number of applications to u.8Under Rm, m 1, 2, 3,  , u 1, this argument fails because in that case, even if all the workers arein contact with a number of vacancies equal to or greater than u 1, the probability a given workergets a job is strictly less than 1. As a result, any number of applications a v can potentially bepart of an equilibrium. Our next result states some general features of wage equilibria.Proposition 1 For any u, v and Rm, i if an equilibrium exists where workers send just one application, the equilibrium wage distribution must be degenerate at the minimum wage w; ii if anequilibrium exists where v a 2 then there must be wage dispersion and the wage distributionmust be atomless; iii for any u and v, if an equilibrium exists where a v minu, v, the equilibrium wage distribution must be degenerate at the minimum wage w under recruitment technology Ru and atomless under R1, R2,  , Ru 1.The proof, which is in the appendix, goes along the following lines.i When a 1, theprobability that a given worker also gets an offer from a competing firm is 0, hence no firm has anincentive to offer w w. So when a 1 the equilibrium wage distribution must be degenerate atw w. ii When minu, v a 2, we can prove the statement above by contradiction. The proofis similar to Burdett and Judd 1983 and Lang 1991. Assume that all firms post some wage win w, 1 in equilibrium. First, we show that there is always a positive probability that a vacancyremains unmatched. Second, we establish the contradiction. Equilibrium profits are: i 1w,where is the probability to fill a vacancy. We show that a firm, say i, can do better by deviatingand offer a higher wage, say w . The firm in question will then always succeed in hiring a worker,provided that it obtains at least an application. This occurs with a probability greater than . Bydeviating, the firm therefore makes profits which are strictly higher than i for sufficiently smallw, this firm would obtain a profit D 0. This argument rules out all wages in w, 1. It remains to be proved that a wage distributiondegenerated at w 1 cannot be an equilibrium either when minu, v a 2. Note that in thiscase firms would make zero profits in equilibrium. If a firm deviates and offers a lower wage, sayi D1 w, where D is the probability that the deviantis matched with a worker. To rule out this case we show that D 0. We finally rule out masspoints with similar arguments. iii Under RU , if a v u, each firm gets u applications andhires a worker with probability 1 and no firm has an incentive to offer a wage above the minimum 9wage. Under R1,  , Ru 1, there is always competition for workers and therefore the arguments inii also hold here.Proposition 1 highlights the influence of multiple applications by workers on wage setting andvice versa. Workers are more likely to send multiple applications in equilibrium when there iswage dispersion. Moreover, wage setting can only be dispersed if a firm faces a positive probabilitythat an applicant is hired by some other firm, which necessarily requires that the applicant sendsmultiple applications. Therefore, wage dispersion and multiple applications are phenomena that aretypically observed together. It is worth to remark that an equilibrium where wages are competitivedoes not exist in this market.Our next result discusses general unemployment features of equilibria. If the number of vacanciesis smaller than the number of unemployed workers then unemployment arises trivially. Moreinterestingly:Proposition 2 Let v u. If an equilibrium exists where a u, then unemployment arises withstrictly positive probability, irrespective of the recruitment technology. If an equilibrium exists wherea u, under Ru there is absence of unemployment, while under R1,  , Ru 1, unemployment doesarise with positive probability.Proof. Note that if a u v, workers always get matched with a vacancy under Ru. However ifa u v, the probability that all unemployed workers only apply to a firms is strictly positive.In that case a maximum of a v workers get matched with vacancies and the remaining u aworkers fail to find a job. For the R1,  Ru 1 case there is always a positive probability that a firmlooses all its candidates to rival firms.5 Proposition 2 highlights that unemployment is a natural phenomenon in our job market model,even if the number of vacancies is greater than the number of workers. This is due to the factthat workers cannot coordinate where to send their applications, which implies that some vacanciesreceive multiple applications from different workers, while others get a single application or noapplications at all. Since firms can only hire a single worker, unemployment arises with positiveprobability.5 Consider for example the case where workers 1, 2, 3 apply to firm A, B, C. There is a positive probability thatall firms consider workers 1 and 3 in which case, 2 remains unmatched and one of the vacancies fails to hire a worker.This argument can be made with any number of workers and jobs. Under Ru 1, there is always a positive probabilitythat none of the v vacancies considers worker i.10Another aspect of this result is that full employment is always associated with wage dispersionexcept for the special case in which the number of vacancies is equal to the number of workerslooking for a job and employers apply screening technology Ru, see Proposition 1. This resultillustrates that it is typically the case that full employment can only be achieved at the cost ofwage inequality because this increases the search intensity.We now move to the existence and characterization of equilibria. The next result characterizesexistence of a degenerate wage equilibrium where workers apply for a single vacancy. For thispurpose we define the following function that gives the expected payoffs of participating in thelabor market for a 1. It is simply equal to the urnball probability of getting a job offer timesthe minimum wage:where 1w; u, v vuw. 1 1 1vu.12Proposition 3 Let 1w; u, v k h 1 1 zd 2i w 1w; u, v, where 1cid:1911 1v cid:20v1 2 zd 0. Then there exists a unique symmetric equilibrium in pure strategies where all firms postthe minimum wage w and workers apply to only one of the vacancies. In equilibrium, a worker isunemployed with probability 1 1w; u, vw, a vacancy remains unfilled with probability 1 1vuand a firms expected profit is i 1 1 1vu 1 w. This holds irrespective of the screeningtechnology.v u 1u1In the proof, which is in the appendix, we show that it must be the case that k is sufficientlylow for workers to participate in the labor market, and sufficiently high to ensure that a workerdoes not find it beneficial to deviate by applying to 2, 3 or more vacancies.We now turn to the existence of wagedispersed equilibria with multiple applications. We firstnote that, given a worker strategy a 2, the number of applications a firm receives is givenby a binomial distribution, binu, av. Since in our model every firm has only one vacancy, ourwage setting game has the features of a Bertrand pricing game with capacity constrained firms.Following Dasgupta and Maskin 1986, it is easy to see that our game has a firm equilibrium inmixed strategies for given a. This is because i a firms strategy space is the closed real intervalw, 1, ii a firms payoff function is continuous in w except in the event that the wage the firm offers 11to a worker coincides with the wage of some other firm which considers the very same candidate andthis wage happens to be the best offer the worker receives so the set of payoff discontinuities hasmeasure zero, and iii the sum of all firms payoffs is a continuous function in a firms strategybecause a firm only steals a worker from another firm when both firms get the same profit perworker. Theorem 5 in Dasgupta and Maskin 1986 proves that an equilibrium in mixed strategiesexists.In the next section we therefore focus on providing a 3x 3 example that highlights all the keymechanisms that are at work in our model. This Section illustrates that the recruitment technologyis not so important for the qualitative nature of the results. In Section 5 we let the labor marketget large in the usual way, i.e., u, v , with v 4 A market with 3 vacancies and 3 workersu and fully analyze a market where Rm R1.This section serves several purposes. First, it illustrates the properties of Nash equilibria in asimple environment. In particular we focus on the nature of wage dispersion and unemploymentas well as on the lack of efficiency of market equilibrium. Second, it shows that different recruitingtechnologies lead to qualitatively similar results; this is because the economic tradeoffs firms andworkers face are common to both technologies. Finally, we see that these tradeoffs are of differentmagnitude under R1 than under R3 and we find that there is more competition for workers under R1, which results in higher wages and higher unemployment than under R3.4.1 The R3 recruitment technology Consider a market where u 3 and v 3 and Rm R3. From Lemma 1 it follows that we mustexamine equilibria with workers applying for 1, 2 and 3 jobs. Proposition 3 yields the equilibriumcharacterization when workers apply to just one job. From 1 it follows that 1w, 3, 3 19w27and it is straightforward to show that a worker who deviates by sending out 2 applications has achance of 1718 to get a job offer. Then:Claim 1 Let u, v 3 and assume 1w, 3, 3 k 1718 w 1w, 3, 3. There exists a uniquesymmetric equilibrium in pure strategies where all firms post the minimum wage w and workersapply to only one of the vacancies. In equilibrium, a worker is employed with probability 1927, avacancy remains unfilled with probability 827 and the expected profit for a firm is i 1927 1 w.12Assume now that workers send multiple applications, in particular a 2. Then by Proposition 2 there does not exist a firm equilibrium in pure strategies. We now present the wagedispersedequilibrium that arises in this setting. For this purpose let us define n:v as the expected value ofthe nth highest wage in a random draw of size v from a wage distribution F w. Moreover let 21w 23w 138113811:3 1:3 12:3 922:3 8111627813:32:3.3Claim 2 Let u, v 3 and and 21w k 23w. Then, under R3 a unique symmetric equilibrium of the game described above exists where vacancies offer wages from the set w, 21w526according to the cumulative wage distribution F w 13s 16 6343 w w1 w4and workers send out 2 applications. In equilibrium workers get a job with probability 7381 andeach firm receives an expected payoff of i 2127 1 w.Proof. The payoff to a firm offering a wage w when the rivals offer a random draw from F w isiw; F w hp 1:3F 2w 2p 2:3F w 1 F w p 3:3 1 F w2i 1 w5where p 1:3, p 2:3 and p 3:3 are the probabilities that a firm offering the highest, second highest andlowest wage in the market hires a worker, respectively. In Appendix B1 we show that p 1:3 2627,p 2:3 2527 and p 3:3 2127. Substitution of them in 5 yields:iw; F w 19F 2w 827F w 2127 1 wThe lower bound of the support of the wage distribution F w must be w. Setting w w yieldsequilibrium profits: iw 2127 1 w . Let w denote the upper bound of the wage distribution.In a mixed strategy equilibrium, a firm must be indifferent between offering any wage in w w, wand offering the minimum wage w. Thus, F w must solve iw; F w iw, which yields 4.Setting F w 1 and solving for w yields the upper bound of the support of the wage distribution.Figure 1 represents the cumulative wage distribution and the frequency of wages. It is interestingto observe that high wages are more frequent than low wages, the reason being that when workerssend two applications, firms must compete intensively to hire a worker.13a Wage distributionb Wage density Figure 1: Equilibrium wage distribution and wage density a 2, w0.2For the wage distribution 4 to be an equilibrium, we must also establish that workers have noincentives to deviate. Since a worker can be hired either for the highest, the medium, or for theminimum wage, the expected payoff for a worker when a 2 is given by:U ea 2 1:3q 1:3 2:3q 2:3 3:3q 3:3 2k The probabilities of being hired at different wages q 1:3, q 2:3and q 3:3 are derived in appendix B2.Equilibrium expected gains to a worker who sends 2 applications can then be rewritten as:6U ea 2 26811:3 25812:3 22813:3 2k.In equilibrium, a worker must obtain nonnegative expected utility, which yields the followingparametric restriction:1381k 1:3 251622:3 11813:3Let 20w denote the RHS of this inequality.In addition, for F w to be an equilibrium it must be the case that workers neither want to senda single application nor 3 applications.

Let q 1:33be the probability that the deviant gets an offer with the highest wage; likewise, let q 2:33and q 3:33be the probability that she gets the second highest wage and the lowest wage when deviating to 3applications, respectively. In appendix B3 we derive that q 1:33 1327, q 2:33 13 and q 3:33 527.Then, the expected utility for the deviant is given by U ed ad 3 13271:3 132:3 5273:3 3k Deviating to a 3 is not profitable ifd ad 3, or:U ea 2 U ek 132627 131:3 8181 1:3 12:3 k 2812581 2:3 53 73:3 23w8127 62281 3:3Finally, we have to establish when it is not profitable to deviate to a 1. Consider a worker whodeviates and sends out just one application. As before, let q 1:3gets the maximum wage, q 2:31 be the probability she gets the second highest wage, and q 3:3probability to get the lowest wage. We derive in appendix B.3 that q 1:31 be the probability that this deviant 1 be the 1 1681 and 1 1381, q 2:3q 3:3 1554. The expected utility for a deviant in this case is given by:U ed ad 1 13811:3 16812:3 15543:3 k Deviating to a 1 is not profitable if:U ea 2 U ed a 1 or:k 261381 131:3 8181 1:3 252:3 1162k 191681 2:3 2281 3:3 21w81 71554 3:3Note that 21w 20w; therefore if condition 7 holds, workers obtain nonnegative utility.The proof is now complete. We finally consider the case where each worker sends 3 applications. The following resultcharacterizes equilibrium in this case. Let w w3.Claim 3 Let u, v 3 and k w. Then under R3 a unique symmetric equilibrium exists where 15all vacancies offer the minimum wage w and workers send out three applications. In equilibriumworkers get a job for sure and firms receive an expected payoff of i 1 w.Proof. When workers apply to all 3 jobs, firms get a worker for sure and have no incentive topay a wage above the minimum wage. The expected payoff for a worker is U ea 3 w 3k.In equilibrium, a worker must obtain nonnegative expected utility. This yields the parametricrestriction k 13 w w.We now check the conditions under which workers do not deviate. Consider a worker whodeviates by sending out 2 applications. The probability that this worker gets no job is 13 . Thisoccurs when vacancies to which the deviant applies for get occupied by other workers. Hence, theexpected payoff for the deviant is U e 3 w 2k. Deviating to a 2 is not profitable if U ea 3 U e 3 w 2k, which is always satisfied when the nonnegativeexpected utility condition holds. Deviating to a 1 is obviously a less profitable deviation whenk w3. This completes the proof. d ad 2 2d ad 2 or w 3k 2Overview of equilibria for the case of 3 vacancies and 3 workers under R3.As shown above, in a market with 3 vacancies and 3 workers equilibria exist where workersapply to either one, two or three vacancies. When workers apply to two vacancies, the equilibriumexhibits wage dispersion while when workers apply to either one or three jobs, all firms post theminimum wage with probability one in equilibrium. When workers apply for one or two jobs, thereis unemployment while each worker gets a job for sure when they apply for three jobs.Firm profits are increasing in the number of applications in this 3x 3 example. An increase inworkers search intensity has two effects. On the one hand, it increases competition between firms,which tends to reduce firms profits. On the other hand, firms increase the probability to fill theirvacancies. The second effect is of greater magnitude in this example and thus firms profits areincreasing in the number of applications sent by the workers in equilibrium. In the next section weshow that this does not hold in a more general setting.The different equilibria exist for distinct parameter constellations.In Figure 2a we haveplotted, in the k, w space, the functions , 21, 23 and that appear in the Propositionsabove. These functions define the parameter areas for which the different equilibria exist. Theshaded regions labelled a 1, a 2 and a 3 indicate the distinct equilibria. The Figurereveals that for high costs of application, say k H, only the equilibrium where workers apply to just 16one job exists and this requires the minimum wage to be quite high. For intermediate applicationcosts, say k M , if the minimum wage is high an equilibrium with a 2 or a 3 exists while if theminimum wage is moderate then a single application equilibrium exists. Finally, for low applicationcosts, like k L, workers typically apply to three jobs in equilibrium.a Equilibriab Welfare Figure 2: Equilibria and Welfare in a 3x 3 model under R3.There are two aspects related to Figure 2a worth to discuss. The first refers to the effectsof an increase in the minimum wage on unemployment.7 The graph reveals that unemploymentis weakly decreasing in w. For high application costs, an increase in the minimum wage has noimpact on unemployment. By contrast, when application costs are moderate or low, unemploymentdecreases in w. The reason for this result is that a higher minimum wage makes applying for morejobs a more attractive strategy and thus a workers probability of being employed increases. Thiscould explain some of the controversies of the huge empirical literature on minimum wages, seee.g. Brown 1999 for an overview. The second aspect pertains to the effects of application costson unemployment. The Figure reveals that, for a fixed minimum wage, unemployment is typicallyweakly increasing in k. What happens is that for low application costs workers apply to all jobsfor sure; for intermediate costs they apply for two jobs only and run into the risk of remainingunemployed. Finally, for high k they apply for a single job and fail more frequently to get a job.Figure 2b shows the levels of welfare attained under the different equilibria. The most efficientequilibrium is the one that maximizes output number of matches times one minus total applicationcost. The graph shows the regions where a 1, a 2 and a 3 are efficient respectively. Theminimum wage has no direct impact on efficiency, it only redistributes income from the firm to the 7 Note that only for R3, unemployment is always decreasing in the number of applications.17worker. It can however be used to select the most favorable equilibrium. A comparison of 2aof and 2b reveals that workers can send either too many or too few applications in equilibrium.For example, if k 0.25 Figure 2b tells us that it is efficient that workers apply for a singlejob; in that case Figure 2a shows that the minimum wage should be set sufficiently high so thatworkers do participate in the labor market but not too high so that workers apply to multiple jobs.Similarly, if k is close to zero, the minimum wage should be set sufficiently high to select the a 3equilibrium.Wages and labor market tightness.We are interested in the relationship between wage setting and the vacancytounemploymentratio vu. Equilibrium wage distributions for different markets when workers apply for two jobsa 2 are compared in Figure 3 below.8Interestingly the wage distributions can be rankedaccording to the first order stochastic dominance criterion. As we increase the vu ratio, firmscompete more intensively for workers and offer higher wages. In Section 5 we shall show that thisresult also arises in large labor markets.Figure 3: Wage distributions for vxu3x 3, 3x 2 and 4x 2 w 0.2, a 2.4.2 The R1 recruitment technology In this Section we derive equilibria in the 3x 3 labor market model when firms can offer the jobonly to one candidate. Under R1 there will be fewer matches in equilibrium than under R3, so we 8 The derivations for the 3x 2 and 4x 2 are similar and can be obtained from the authors upon request.18can think of this case as a high frictions case. Interestingly, workers can actually be better off inthis high frictions case because firms compete more intensively for them and the resulting wagedistribution first order stochastically dominates the one of the low frictions case. Most derivationsare similar to the ones under R3, so we only summarize for which values of k, a 1, a 2, anda 3 are equilibria and what the associated wage distributions are details of the derivations canbe found in the Appendix.For obvious reasons, if workers send just one application, the possibility of second round offershas no bearing on wage setting behavior. Hence Claim 1 also holds here.Assume now that workers send out 2 applications each. In this case, it is convenient to introducethe following notation: let En denote the expected maximum wage from a random sample of sizen from the wage distribution F w and let 20w 21w 12 8616217162E1 35162E2E1 E2 2516215162E3Claim 4 Let u, v 3 and 20w k 21w. Then under R1 a unique symmetric equilibrium exists where workers send out 2 applications and firms choose wages from the set w, 3543w78according to the cumulative wage distribution F w 4335w w1 w162 and firms obtain an expected payoff of i 8In equilibrium workers get a job with probability 12181 1 w.43It is interesting to compare equilibrium wage setting with and without second round offers forthis case where a 2. Figure 4 represents wage setting under R3, given in 4, and under R1equation 8. The graph shows that 8 dominates 4 under the criterion of firstorder stochasticdominance. This implies that firm competitiveness is enhanced by the absence of second round offersand thus worker expected utility may be greater in the more frictional case. For the intermediatecase R2 one would expect the wage distribution to lie in between the two curves.We now present the results in case workers send 3 applications. For this purpose let 32w 19E2 127E319Figure 4: Wage distributions under Ru and R1 3x 3 market, w 0.2, a 2.Claim 5 Let u, v 3 and 32w k. Then under R1 a unique symmetric equilibrium existswhere workers send out 3 applications and firms choose wages from the set w, 54w according to 9the cumulative wage distribution F w 2Ar 1 w 1 w 1!9In equilibrium workers get a job with probability 199 1 w.427 and firms obtain an expected payoff of i The difference with section 4.1 where firms could make second and third round offers is thatnow a firm can fail to hire a worker and therefore there is competition for workers. This results inwage dispersion and, interestingly, may result in greater worker welfare. To illustrate this, considerthe case that w 3k; with second round offers, firms offer the minimum wage in equilibrium andthe payoff to a worker is thus zero. By contrast, in the case without second round offers there iswage dispersion for a low w a a 3 equilibrium exists and thus a workers expected payoff isstrictly positive. Hence, a more restrictive matching technology can increase the expected utilityof workers by making them effectively scarcer.The set of parameters for which distinct equilibria exist under the recruitment technology R1is represented in Figure 5a.A comparison of Figures 2a and 5a reveals that the screening technology does not affect the 20a Equilibriab Welfare Figure 5: Equilibria and Welfare in a 3x 3 model under R1.qualitative observations we have made above. R1 has the advantage that the combinatorics neededto calculate expected payoffs for firms and workers is easier for large labor markets. In what followswe will confine the analysis to R1 and derive general properties of large labor markets.Figure 5b plots aggregate welfare for the R1 case for different values of k. The main differencewith the R3 case in Figure 2b is that a 3 is never efficient. The reason is that a 1 and a 3generate the same number of matches because under a 1 all three workers apply to one job whilethe a 3 case can be thought of as all three firms applying to one worker. Since applying is costly,a 3 can never be efficient and the minimum wage should be set low so that it prevents workersfrom sending an excessive number of applications.5 Large labor markets In this section we let the labor market get large in the usual way, i.e., u, v , with vu . Werestrict ourselves to the R1 case as argued above. We focus on existence and characterization of theequilibrium with multiple applications the equilibrium for a 1 follows straightforwardly from Proposition 3. We are also interested in how the equilibrium number of applications and the wagedistribution are affected by the market tightness parameter . Later in this Section we endogenize by examining the freeentry longrun equilibrium and we study the efficiency properties of theequilibrium.Our first result characterizes wage setting behavior by firms, given workers strategies.21F w; a, , w 1 z, aProposition 4 For any value of , and a 2, there exists an equilibrium wage distributionz, a 1 w 1 w 1with supportw, 1 1 w1 z, aa 1 , where z, a . Further, the distribution of wages F w; a, , w 4 dominates in a firstorder stochastic sense the distribution of wages F w; a, , w, and F w; a, 4, w firstorder stochastically dominates F w; a, , w.Proof: Recall that u, v, a is the urn ball probability that a firm gets at least one applicant. 11exp a a 1a Thus:, a limu,v, vu 31 31 av u 1 exp 3a If the firm receives more than one application, the firm picks one of them at random. The randomlychosen applicant has sent a total of a applications, so he can potentially get 1, 2, 3,  , up to atotal of a 1 other wage offers.Let zu, v, a be the probability for one of the a 1 other applications of the worker to resultin a job offer. We use the result of Albrecht et al. 2003 that in the limit u, v , vu ,getting an offer from firm j is independent of getting an offer from firm i 6 j. Then, z, a u zu, v, a is simply equal to the number of firms with applications divided by thelimu,v, vtotal number of applications:z, a , aa 1 exp a a A firm does not compete for the worker in question with probability 1 z, aa 1, competeswith just one other firm with probability a 1z, a1z, aa 2, and so on. Thus the expectedpayoff to a firm i can be written as:iw; F , aa 1Xj0a 1j z, aj1 z, aa 1j F wj 1 wWe can use the binomial theorem to simplify 10 to:10Eiw; F , a 1 z, a z, aF wa 1 1 wSince in a mixed strategy equilibrium, all firms must be indifferent between strategies, profits 22of any firm must be equal to the profits of a firm that offers the minimum wage.Eiw; F , a 1 z, aa 1 1 w11Solving Ew; F Ew; F yields the equilibrium wage distribution given above. Theupper bound of the support of the wage distribution can be found by setting F w, a, 1. It iseasy to see that the upper bound of the distribution of wages is less than 1, increasing in a for agiven and in for a given a.To prove the results on stochastic dominance, we first note that F is monotonically decreasingin z, a and in w. Secondly we note that the function z, a is increasing in , which can be seenfromdz, ad exp a a a exp a 12Notice that the LHS of the numerator increases exponentially in a while the RHS increases linearly;thus, if dz, ad 0 for a 2, then the same inequality holds generally. We then need to checkthat exp2 1 2, which holds for all 0. The proof is now complete. Proposition 4 shows that an increase in the vacancytounemployment ratio results in a rightward shift of the wage distribution. Thus, wage setting behavior becomes more competitive as themarket tightness parameter increases. An increase in the minimum wage w has a similar influenceon the wage distribution.We now discuss how the average wage depends on the number of applications a. Using Proposition 4, the expected wage can be written as using integration by parts and changing the variableof integrationEw; , a 1 Z 101 w1 z, aa 11 z, a1 ya 1 dy.The influence of the number of applications on the average wage is given by the following expression:We note thatd EwdaEwaEwzdzda.EwzZ 101 w a 1y1 za 21 z1 ya 0,dzda1 za z 023131415while Ewa Z 101 z1 ya 1 ln1 w 1 za 11 z 1 z1 y dy 0where the last inequality follows from the fact that the integrand is negative. From the sign of thesepartial derivatives, it follows that an increase in a results in two forces on competitiveness that goin opposite directions. To understand this, consider a firm offering a job to a candidate when eachworker sends out a applications. If the worker increases the number of applications to a 1, oneforce increases the probability that the firm looses the worker to another firm simply because theworker can get one additional offer with a higher wage. This effect increases firm competitivenessand is captured by the first term of the RHS of equation 13. However, when all workers senda 1 applications, the probability that each of the other a applications of the candidate in questionresults in a job offer falls. This is simply due to the fact that all firms have more applicants tochoose from. This effect tends to weaken firms competition and is captured by the second term inthe RHS of 13. Which effect dominates turns out to be sensitive to market parameters but wecan prove the following result:Corollary 1 There exists a sufficiently largee such that the expected wage increases in the numberof applications a for all e. Further, in a neighborhood of a 2, the expected wage increases ina for all .Corollary 1 shows two results. First, that the expected wage is always increasing in the number ofapplications in a neighborhood of a 2. The idea here is that the second force dzda 0 is smallwhen the number of applications is low. In that case, competition unambiguously increases whenworkers send more applications. The second result is that the expected wage is always increasingin the number of applications provided that there are sufficiently many firms around. The idea issimilar. When there are many firms in the market, an increase in the number of applications ais likely to increase the number of firms that compete for the same worker, which increases firmcompetitiveness. Numerical analysis of equation 13, however, has revealed that the expectedwage may fall in a for some parameters; this can be seen in Figure 6 where we have computed theexpected wage for different values of the labor market tightness parameter . The Figure showsthat when a is relatively large e.g. 10 a 80 and 2 4 then the expected wage decreasesin the number of applications workers send out. The graph also illustrates the stochastic dominanceresult provided in Proposition 4: for a fixed a, the expected wage increases in .24Figure 6: Expected wage and the number of applications for different values, w 0.We now turn to the workers problem. A worker maximizes utility taking firm wage setting andother workers strategies as given. The gross expected utility of a worker sending al applicationswhen the rest of the workers sends a applications is given by the following expression:jz, aj1 z, aalj j F wj 1 wf wdww al Xj1al Eual; a Z w This expression tells us that a worker who sends al applications gets a single offer with probability alz1 zal 1 and in this case the wage the worker expects to get is the mean wage; the 2z 21 zal 2 and then the wage the worker expects toworker gets two offers with probabilityalget is the maximum of a random sample of size 2; and so on and so forth.9 Using the binomial16theorem, equation 16 can be rewritten as Eual; a alz, aZ wwand integration by parts yields:1 z, a1 F wal 1wf wdw Eual; a w w1 z, aal Z ww1 z, a1 F waldw 9 In the empirical job search literature an important distinction is made between the offer distribution, F and thedistribution of accepted wage offers which is in our case very similar to the term in brackets of 16: G a, , w j cid:4z, aj1z, aa 1j F wj. This is basically a combination of the wage offer F w and the probabilitythat the worker accepts the offer which depends on the number of other offers and on the magnitude of the offer.j0cid:3a 1cid:83a 125Changing the variable of integration appropriately, we can rewrite a typical workers utility as:Eual; a Z 1y Integration of this expression yields:1 w1 z, aal 11z,aal 1 al1 w1 z, aa 11 1 z, aal1a dyal 1al17Eual; a 1 1 z, aal al 1 a The marginal gains to a worker sending al applications are given byd Eual; adal 1 z, aal log1 z, a a 11 1 z, aal1a alal 1 a log1 z, a1 z, aal1a18al 1 a21 w1 z, aa 1In symmetric equilibrium, the marginal gains from applying to a vacancies must be equal to themarginal cost k. Invoking symmetry in 18 yields the following equilibrium condition:Or d Eual; adal k ala191 z, aa log1 z, a 1 w1 z, aa 1z, a a1 z, a log1 z, a k20The LHS of 20 represents the equilibrium marginal gains to workers when they apply to a vacancies. Let us denote these marginal gains as a; , w. We now make the following observations onthis function: i a; , w is continuous in a and strictly positive everywhere. The latter followsfrom noting thata, , w 1 w1 za log1 z 1 w1 za 1z a1 z log1 z 1 w1 za 1a 1z 1 z log1 z 0where the last inequality follows from z 0, 1. ii It is easy to see that these marginal gainsconverge to zero as a approaches infinity. These two conditions guarantee existence of equilibriumfor sufficiently low application cost k.10 As a result, we can state:10 To show uniqueness we need to check that, for any and w, dada 0. Analytically this is difficult butnumerical analysis of this derivative suggests that this is the case.26Theorem 1 Let 0 k 2, , w. Then an equilibrium exists where workers send a 2 applications and firms randomly choose wages from the setw, 1 1 w1 z, aa 1 accordingto the wage distribution F w; a, , w 1 z, az, a 1 w 1 w 1a 1 1where a solves a; , w k 0. The equilibrium unemployment rate is 1 z , aa .Our next question is how an increase in the vacancytounemployment ratio, , affects theequilibrium number of applications a as well as unemployment rate. To answer this question, weexamine how the equilibrium marginal gains from applications change with .11 This follows fromthe following derivative:da, , wd a 1ea 1 a1 zaaaae e 12a 1ea 1aaea ea 1 log1z 21The sign of the first factor in 21 is negative since eof this derivative depends only on the last factor in the numerator. Let , a a 1e 1 aae 1 a is always positive. Thus, the sign 1 log1 z. We note that for any given a, z, a is continuous in , convergesto 1 as approaches infinity and converges to zero as approaches zero. As a result, , a is eaaaanegative for small and positive for large. This implies that:Proposition 5 There exists a sufficiently small such that for all the equilibrium numberof applications a is increasing in . Moreover, there exists a sufficiently large such that for all the equilibrium number of applications a is decreasing in .This result shows that the equilibrium number of applications is nonmonotonic in . To ourknowledge this result is new. For example, Pissarides 2000 treats search intensity as a technologyparameter and finds that search effort is always increasing in . In our model, the marginal gainsfrom applying are decreasing in when is initially large. We illustrate this Proposition in Figure 7, where we have computed the equilibrium number of applications as a function of the markettightness parameter , for different values of the minimum wage. The graph shows that the functiona is unimodular.11 We set w 0 here for simplicity.27Figure 7: Equilibrium number of applications and market tightness parameter .The intuition is the following. We note that, for a fixed number of applications a, a change in has an effect on the probability that a worker is hired as well as on the wage the worker expectsto be paid. When is small 0 the total number of applications swamps the total number ofvacancies. The probability that a given worker gets a job offer is quite low. A given firm receivesmany applicants and the likelihood that it competes with another firm for a given candidate is closeto zero; as a result the wage distribution is close to the degenerate distribution at the minimumwage. As increases, the probability a worker receives a job offer goes up, and also the probabilitythat firms have to compete for the same candidate rises; these two effects increase substantiallythe marginal gains from sending applications. As increases further, those two effects becomeweaker and weaker because the probability to get several job offers and the gains associated tochoosing from among several wages are already large and do not increase much further. Indeed for relatively large each vacancy gets either no or one applicant, so the chance a firm is competingwith some other firm for the same candidate is close to 1; as a result the wage distribution is closeto the degenerate distribution at the competitive wage. Thus as increases beyond some criticallevel, the marginal gains from sending applications become smaller.We now ask how the equilibrium unemployment rate changes with the vacancytounemploymentratio. There are two effects at work here. For a given number of applications, an increase in increases the chance that a worker gets an offer since applications are spread over a larger setor vacancies. This effect tends to decrease the unemployment rate. However, an increase in the 28number of vacancies also changes the incentives workers have to apply for jobs cf. Proposition 5.An analytical answer to this question thus requires to examine the following derivative:d1 z, aad1 z, aa1 z, aaaa.The first term of the RHS of this equation is clearly negative. Some calculations show that1 z, aaa 1 zalog1 z 1 az1 z .This expression is positive when is small. For large it depends on a; if a is relatively small thenit is negative while if a is large it is positive. As a result, this derivative does not yield clearcutresults. For the majority of the parameters, the two effects mentioned above work in oppositedirections. To gain some insight into this issue, we have numerically computed the probabilityto remain unemployed as a function of the vacancytounemployment ratio. The results show anegative relationship between these two variables see Figure 8 below.Our last question in this section is how the minimum wage affects the equilibrium numberof applications a and the unemployment rate. We first examine how the marginal gains fromapplications change when the minimum wage goes up. This is given by the following derivative:da, , wdw 1 z, aa 1a 1z, a a1 z, a log1 z, a22We now make two remarks about this expression. One, for a fixed a, expression 22 converges tozero as approaches zero and is positive and increasing in in a neighborhood of 0. Thus, fora sufficiently small the number of applications workers send in equilibrium is increasing in theminimum wage. Two, we note that 22 is negative for large and goes to zero when approachesinfinity. Then for large , the equilibrium number of applications is decreasing in the minimumwage.To examine the implications of the minimum wage on unemployment rate, we computed1 z, aadw1 z, aaaaw As argued above, the first term of the RHS of this expression is positive when is small. As aresult, we conclude that an increase in the minimum wage raises unemployment whenever is lowenough. When is large and a moderate, this term is negative and thus a minimum wage increasecan decrease unemployment. Finally, when and a are both large this term is positive and then 29again an increase in w leads to lower unemployment. The following Proposition summarizes:Proposition 6 There exists a sufficiently small such that for all the equilibrium numberof applications a is increasing in the minimum wage w. Moreover, there exists a sufficiently large such that for all the equilibrium number of applications a is decreasing in w. Moreover,the unemployment rate is increasing in w for sufficiently low , and for sufficiently high , while itcan decrease for intermediate values of .The intuition behind this result is the following. First, note that an increase in the minimumwage does not affect the probability that a worker is hired but it does affect the wage a workerexpects to get. When is low, the wage distribution is close to the degenerate distribution atthe minimum wage and thus an increase in the minimum wage shifts the marginal gains fromapplications upwards and makes the distribution less compressed note from Theorem 1 that themaximum wage rises when the minimum wage increases. By contrast, when is large, the wagedistribution is close to the degenerate distribution at the competitive wage and thus an increase inthe minimum wage reduces the marginal gains from applications by making the distribution evenmore compressed.12 The result in Proposition 6 is illustrated above in Figure 7. The graph showsthat when is low, workers react to an increase in the minimum wage by sending more applications,while the opposite holds for relatively large.The unemployment effects of an increase in the minimum wage also depend on initial conditions.For low approximately 12, the unemployment rate is monotonically increasing in a see Albrecht et al., 2003 and we know from Proposition 6 that an increase in the minimum wage raisesthe equilibrium number of applications. As a result the minimum wage increases unemployment.Likewise, when 12 unemployment is first increasing and then decreasing in a. We knowfrom Proposition 5 that a is excessive. Then, increasing the minimum wage compresses the wagedistribution and reduces the equilibrium number of applications which also increases employment.What is striking here is that a minimum wage can be desirable because it reduces rather thanincreases the number of applications. This is a very different mechanism than the ones that arecurrently emphasized in the literature; making it more likely that a job is accepted i.e. Burdettand Mortensen, 1998, and increasing the search intensity or driving out less productive firms i.e.12 Lee 1999 and Teulings 2003 give empirical evidence that minimum wage increases compress the wagedistribution.30Van den Berg 2003. What is also striking is that a minimum wage is most desired when is large.In section 5.2, we will further discuss the welfare effects of the minimum wage with endogenousvacancy supply.5.1 Efficiency Is the labor market equilibrium constrainedefficient? In order to answer this question we definethe planners objective function as total output net of application cost and vacancy cost, wheretotal output is simply equal to the number of matches times 1. Dividing by unemployment givesthe welfare per worker: maxa,1 1 z , aa ak23We first examine whether workers incentives to apply for jobs are socially optimal. The firstorder condition with respect to a isdda 1 z , aa 11 z, a log1 z , a adz , ada k 0.Substituting in 15 yields 1 z , aa log1 z , a 1 z , aa 11 z, a az, a k24A comparison of the workers equilibrium condition 20 with 24 yields the following result:Proposition 7 The equilibrium number of applications is excessive from the point of view of socialwelfare maximization.Proof. The first term in 20 is identical to the first term in 24 so we need to show that1 w a 1z a1 z log1 z 1 z, a az, a25We first note that the RHS of 25 is negative. Second, the LHS of 25 is always positive for large 2.81 and therefore the result follows. For small 2.81 the LHS is negative whena is sufficiently small and thus we need to evaluate 25. Note that if the results holds for w 0, italso holds for all w. Setting w 0, 25 can be written as a1 za 1z 1 z log1 z z11 za 1 az 1 0 and a threedimensional plot of this expression shows that the inequalityis always satisfied. 31This result, illustrated in Figure 8, shows that workers send too many applications in equilibrium. The left graph shows a comparison of the equilibrium number of applications a and theefficient amount a SB. The right graph shows the consequences of excessive applications on theunemployment rate.a Number of applicationsb Unemployment rate Figure 8: Private and social incentives to send applications k 0.01, w 0To get some intuition for this result, suppose that the minimum wage is set equal to 1.Inthis case wage dispersion is fully eliminated and the only reason to send applications is to increasethe chance to get a job. A comparison between 20 and 24 when w 1 reveals that thereare too many applications in equilibrium. The reason is that an individual worker does not takeinto account the externalities hisher applications cause on the hiring probability of other workersthe second term of 24 is negative. When the minimum wage is set below 1, there is wagedispersion and hence workers have an additional motive to send applications, namely, to increasetheir expected wage. As we mentioned before, the minimum wage can thus play a useful role inreducing congestion externalities by compressing the wage distribution and reducing the equilibriumnumber of applications.This discussion suggests that the only way to get an efficient outcome in this economy is toapplications in this case with the efficiency condition 24 leads to the following result.eliminate wage dispersion. Suppose the government fixed a mandatory wage bw. Using 16, workersexpected utility would be EU al; a 1 1 zaalbw.

We start with a considerationof firm entry for an exogenously given number of applications a. Let c be the cost of opening avacancy. For a given number of workers u, and a given number of applications a, the free entryequilibrium is given by the vacancytounemployment ratio that solves Eiw; F c 0 alongwith the equilibrium wage setting behavior given in Proposition 4. Or, using 11,az, a 1 z, aa 1 1 w c For convenience, we rewrite this freeentry condition as:log az, a a 1 log1 z, a log1 w logc2627Let us denote the LHS of this expression as , a. We first note that 27 has a unique solutionin for any given set of feasible parameters. This follows from the following three observations:i lim 0 , a 0, ii lim , a and 22 a 2ea 2ae 0 for all a 2. 1 ed, aiiia da 11 e1 eaaa 1 ea Inspection of the freeentry condition 27 immediately shows that the longrun number of vacanciesdecreases in the minimum wage, for any given a. The intuition is simple: entry becomes lessprofitable as w gets larger.We now ask how the freeentry number of vacancies depends on workers search activity. Toanswer this question we examine how the gains from entry change with a. This is given by thefollowing derivative:d, ada a 1a 1 ea aae 1 eaa 11 e log1 z, a.a 28The sign of this expression depends in a complicated way on a and : the first term is positive,while the second and the third terms are negative. However, it can be seen that in a neighborhoodof a 2, d, ada is always negative. As a result, is initially decreasing in a. Numericalanalysis of 28 reveals that its sign can become positive for a relatively high a and intermediatelevels of . We have numerically calculated the free entry number of vacancies as a function of a;33the results reveal that the number of vacancies that open in the freeentry equilibrium is typicallynonmonotonic in a. Figure 9 shows as a function of a for various levels of the minimum wage. Itcan be seen that initially falls sharply with a and then it can slightly increase in a. The intuitionis the following. Inspection of the LHS of equation 26 reveals that an increase in a leads to twoeffects. The first effect is positive and tells us that the likelihood to get candidates is increasing ina, while the second effect is negative and reflects the probability that one or more rival firms alsoconsider your candidate, which increases the equilibrium wage and reduces profits. These effectsare relatively important for low values of a but become insignificant as a gets large. The exponenta 1 makes the second effect vanish faster than the first effect and this explains the result.Figure 9: Free entry number of vacancies for fixed a, c 0.1.We now look at the freeentry equilibrium when workers are active and decide how manyapplications to send to maximize their expected utility. Taking into account equilibrium wagesetting Proposition 4, a freeentry equilibrium is then characterized by the solution to the systemof equations 20 and 26. We note that both equilibrium conditions 20 and 26 are nonmonotonic and this makes it very difficult to characterize sets of parameters c, k, w for which theexistence and uniqueness of a longrun equilibrium is guaranteed. This is something we will notpursue in this paper. However, to gain some insight into this issue we have simulated the economyfor multiple parameter values c, k and w. We find that when application costs are low comparedto entry costs, a freeentry equilibrium with endogenous applications always exists and is uniquelydetermined. When entry costs are very low and application costs are large, there may be existence 34problems. Figure 10 illustrates a market where both entry and application costs are relatively lowc k 0.01 and w 0. The curve labelled U0a k is the workers equilibrium condition20, while the curve labelled E 0 is the zeroprofits condition. It can be seen that the curvesintersect only once, at the point marked Eq. In this example, the long run equilibrium is givenby the pair a, 20.5, 4.3.Figure 10: Freeentry equilibrium c k 0.01 and w 0Using Figure 10, it is straightforward to ascertain the influence of parameters c and k on thelongrun equilibrium. A decrease in entry cost c shifts the free entry condition to the right. Inmarkets with very few vacancies small, this results in a larger number of firms and in moreapplications. By contrast, in markets with many vacancies like in Figure 10, the number ofapplications decreases. Similarly, we can ask how a decrease in application cost k affects the longrun equilibrium. We note that this change shifts the workers equilibrium condition upwards, whichresults in a larger number of applications and in entry of vacancies.Next, we are interested in how the minimum wage w influences the longrun equilibrium. Wenote that this influence is highly sensitive to the initial market conditions. First, we have seen howan increase in the minimum wage can lead to more or less applications, depending on the numberof vacancies Proposition 6. Second, an increase in w affects not only the workers equilibriumcondition but also the free entry condition. This is illustrated in Figure 11, where c k 0.01. Thesolid curves correspond to a situation where w 0, while the dashed curves show the case w 0.2.The graph reveals the following feature of the freeentry equilibrium: an increase in the minimum 35wage w always leads to exit and, if initially there are sufficiently many firms in the market, to moreapplications; otherwise to fewer applications. This surprising result stems from the fact that if is large, many wage offers are already close to the competitive wage and further increases of theminimum wage therefore reduce the marginal gains of additional applications.Figure 11: Free entry equilibrium for w 0 solid curves and w 0.2 dashed curves.The last issue we investigate is whether the freeentry longrun equilibrium is constrained efficient. We know already that the answer to this question is negative because the private incentivesto send applications are excessive for any . However, we still can ask whether the freeentry equilibrium number of firms is excessive or insufficient from a social welfare perspective. The plannersproblem consists of maximizing c, where is defined in equation 23. For a fixed a, theoptimal vacancytounemployment ratio is then given by the following first order condition:dd a 1 z , aa 1 dz , ad c 0Or, substituting the expression for dzd :dd a 1 z , aa 1 z, a exp a c 02930Comparing 26 with 30 reveals that firms incentives to enter are not socially efficient. Anefficient outcome requireswhich implies that:z, a1 w z, a expa,36Proposition 9 For any given number of applications a, there exists a sufficiently low minimumwage bw such that for all w bw firms incentives to enter the labor market are excessive; moreover,there exists a sufficiently large minimum wage ew such that for all w ew firms incentives to enterthe labor market are insufficient.7 Final remarks We presented a simple strategic wage setting game where workers must decide upon the numberof jobs they apply for and firms simultaneously post a wage taking into account the effect thatthe wage has on the behavior of workers and where workers similarly take into account the effectthat their search intensity has on wages. Quite surprisingly, this model generates, even in themost simple setting, many interesting insights. We show that an equilibrium where workers applyto just one job exhibits unemployment and absence of wage dispersion; this type of Diamondresult cannot be sustained generally. An equilibrium where workers apply for two or more jobstypically exhibits wage dispersion and unemployment. In addition, we showed that there exists afirst order stochastic dominance relation between wage distributions of labor markets with differentvacancytounemployment ratios and minimum wages; however average wage is nonmonotonic inthe number of applications. Finally, we showed that the resulting equilibrium is not efficient.Workers cause too much congestion by sending out too many applications.Introduction of aminimum wage can improve welfare when the vacancytounemployment ratio is large since itreduces the number of applications but the only way to align the private and the social incentivesis to impose a mandatory wage that eliminates wage dispersion altogether.References1 Acemoglu, D. and R.

When a 1 this occurs with probability 0, hence no firm hasan incentive to offer w w. So when a 1 the equilibrium wage distribution must be degenerateat w w.ii Consider now the case in which minu, v a 2 in equilibrium. We prove the statementabove by contradiction. Assume that all firms post some wage w in w, 1 in equilibrium. Thepayoff of a firm depends positively on the probability that a vacancy succeeds in hiring a workerand negatively on the posted wage. First, we show that a vacancy remains vacant with a strictlypositive probability, i.e., 1. When u v, this is easy because then uv 1, for all a. Ifu v, a firm with applicants fails to hire a worker when all its applicants get hired by other firms.To show that 1 also in this case, it is enough to find an event that can occur with positiveprobability where some firm i with applicants fails to fill its vacancy. An example of such an eventis the case where some firm i only gets a single application from one of the workers, say j. It isobvious that this event can indeed occur with positive probability, for all 2 a v 1 and forany u. Suppose this event is realized; then there is a positive probability that this applicant j getshired by some other firm different than i; as a result 1. Second, we establish a contradiction.Note that equilibrium the profits to firm i are i 1 w. We now show that firm i can dobetter by deviating and offering a higher wage, say w . If this is so, the firm in question willalways succeed in hiring a worker, provided that it obtains at least an application. This occursvu , which is greater than .13 By deviating, the firm would make profitswith probability 11 avu 1 w , which are strictly higher than i for sufficiently small 0. Thisi 1 1 a Dargument rules out all wages in w, 1. It remains to be proved that a wage distribution degeneratedat w 1 cannot be an equilibrium either when minu, v a 2. Note that in this case firmswould make zero profits in equilibrium. If a firm deviates and offers a lower wage, say w, this firmi D1w, where D is the probability that the deviant is matched withwould obtain a profit Da worker. To rule out this case we need to show that D 0. Consider first that u v. To provethat D 0, it is sufficient to give an example of an event that can arise with positive probabilitywhere the deviant hires a worker, for 2 a u. This is easy because even if the deviant getsonly one applicant, there is a positive probability that this candidate gets no offers from any of theother firms to which she applied for a job. Therefore, D 0 when u v and a firm would gainby deviating. Next consider u v. Let us number the vacancies from 1 to V 1 and the workersfrom 1 to U. Once again, to prove that D 0, it is sufficient to find a positiveprobability eventin which the deviant hires a worker for sure, now for 2 a v 1. An example of such an eventis the case where worker j applies for vacancy i j, for the deviants vacancy and possibly forsome other vacancies and worker 1 is picked by vacancy 1, worker 2 is picked by vacancy 2,  , andworker V 1 is picked by vacancy V 1. In that case, the deviant hires worker V or any otherworker from V to U with probability 1. Therefore, the deviant would gain by deviating. So wehave established that if minu, v a 2, there is no wage equilibrium in pure strategies. Thesame type of arguments can be used to show that this also holds when a u v. We finally arguethat if an equilibrium wage distribution F w exists, it must be atomless. The proof follows thearguments above and we only sketch it here. Suppose, on the contrary, that there were atoms in the 13Since p 1 1 avu 1 Pr all candidates get hired by other firms .39wage distribution and consider a firm offering a wage bw such that d F bw 0. Then, with strictlypositive probability, such firm would tie with all other firms at offering bw, and as shown before,the firm would gain by offering a slightly higher wage. An atom at the competitive wage cannotarise in equilibrium either because a firm offering such wage would have an incentive to deviateand offer a lower one. Those arguments hold for any recruiting technology Rm. In addition, under R1, ,Ru 1 they also hold for v a u.iii Under Ru. If a v u, each firm gets u applications and hires a worker with probability 1and no firm has an incentive to offer a wage above the minimum wage. Under R1, ,Ru 1, there isalways competition for workers and therefore the arguments in ii also hold here. This completesthe proof. Proof of Proposition 3u1 cid:1911 1v u 1u1v cid:20v1 2In this appendix we calculate a sufficient condition for an equilibrium with a 1 to exist. Thefirst condition is that participation yields nonnegative payoffs. Hence, 1 w k. The secondcondition is that deviating to a 2 is not profitable. To calculate the payoffs from such a deviationwe must first calculate the probability to get a job offer when applying for 2 jobs when the otherworkers apply to one job. Let E1 be the probability that the deviants first application resultsin an offer and E2 be the probability that his second application results in an offer. Note thatvu 1 1 2, where b 31 1 1that a vacancy has applications one minus the probability that nondeviant workers do not applyminus the probability that the deviant does not apply. The probability that at least one ofv is the probability P E1 z cid:101vthe deviants applications results in an offer is 1 PE1 PE2E1 which is only in the limitu equal to 1 PE12, see Albrecht et al. 2004. A negative dependency is au, v , vgeneral property of finite urnball type of models: if a subset of the urns receives many balls thena disjoint subset of the urns must receive a few balls. Hence the fact that the first application doesnot result in a match gives implicit information on the total number of applications the firm wherethis application landed had. The likelihood that the second one does not result in an offer thereforebecomes smaller. If E1,  , En are negatively associated:14PE1,  , En P E1n,Next, we turn to the proof. Assume for the moment that a 1 in equilibrium. First note that anapplicant gets either a single wage offer or no wage offer at all. As a result, a firm offering a wageto a worker faces no competition from other firms to hire such worker. This implies that firms haveno incentives to offer wages above the minimum wage since doing so does not increase the hiringprobability. Hence, the equilibrium payoff to a firm is i 1 w, where is the probabilityof succeeding in hiring a worker. Note that the number of applications that a firm receives is arandom variable with a binu, av distribution. Then, is the standard urnballprobability tovu .get one or more applicants, i.e., 1 1 1We now check that a 1 is indeed a workers bestresponse. In equilibrium, the expected utilityfor a worker is equal to U e zw k, where z is the probability that a worker gets a job. Thisprobability can be easily computed, z vu . Expected utility in equilibrium is nonnegative if andonly if the condition k w; u, v holds. A potential deviant worker who sends out 2 applications 14I.e. for the 3x 3 case,31 PE12 11271296 while 1 PE1 PE2E1 1112 .40will get a job with a probability that is at least 11 z2 where z is given above. So her expectedd a 2 31 1 z2 w 2k. For a symmetric equilibrium, we need thatutility is at least U eworkers have no incentives to deviate, i.e. it must be the case that zw k h 1 1 z2i w 2k,or k h 1 1 z2i w 1w; u, v. Finally, the upper bound comes from setting z 1. We notethat this condition also ensures that a worker does not find it beneficial to apply to 3 or morevacancies. The proof is now complete. B Hiring probabilities for R3 v 3, u 3, a 2B.1 Derivation of pn:3in the market hires a worker, respectively. Note that p 1:3 1 1 2p 1:3,p 2:3and p 3:3 are the probabilities that a firm offering the highest, second highest and lowest wage 27 . To calculate p 2:3,note that the second highest wage firm always hires a worker when it has 2 or more applicants andit remains vacant when it has one applicant and this applicant gets hired by the highest wage firm.The likelihood that the candidate at the second highest wage firm also applied to the highest wagefirm is 12 . Given that the candidate in question is the only applicant at the second highest wage firmand he also applied to the highest wage firm, there must be 3 candidates at the highest wage firm sohe gets hired by that firm with probability 13. The probability that a firm gets exactly 1 candidate 27 .

First note that a worker applies to vacancy A with probability 23and, conditional on applying, she is the only applicant at vacancy A with probability 19workers 2and 3 both have a 1probability 4candidates. Hence:9 she is one of the two candidates at A, and with probability 49 she is one of the 332chance to not apply to the same vacancy worker 1 has applied to.

As a result, the equilibrium characterization for a 1 is identical tothat in the R3 case.Next, take a 2. This generates a wagedispersed equilibrium. To derive the payoff to a firm ioffering a wage w when the rivals offer a random draw from F w, we consider the following events.First, note that the number of applicants a firm receives is binu, ahas no applicants is 127, that it has 1 applicant is 627, that it has two applicants is 1227 andthat it has 3 applicants is 827. If firm i has one applicant, the other firm where this candidateapplied to has in total 3 applications with probability 1. If firm i has 2 candidates, the firm picksone of them at random and makes an offer to himher. It may be the case that the chosen workeris queueing together with the two other workers in the other firm he applied for, which happenswith probability 12 and in this case firm i hires the worker with probability 23 13F w; orit may be the case that the chosen worker has just one competitor for the offer of the other firmhe applied for, which happens with probability 12 and in this case firm i hires the worker withprobability 12 12F w. If firm i has three applicants is, the firm picks one of them at randomv, so the probability firm i 42again and makes an offer to himher. The chosen applicant may be queueing with no other workerin the other vacancy he applied for, which happens with probability 14 and in this case firm ihires the worker with probability F w; or it may be the case that the chosen worker is queueingwith just one other worker in the other vacancy he applied for, which happens with probability 24and in this case firm i hires the worker with probability 12 12F w; or, finally, it may be thecase that the chosen worker is queueing with two other workers in the other vacancy he appliedfor, which happens with probability 14 and in this case firm i hires the worker with probability 23 13F w.Collecting terms gives the following payoff:23827 2iw; F w 627 14 2 6 4362723132781121413283121313F w 27 12 2F w 4 1F w F w 27 122 27 127 12 27 1F w 1 w35812412241223132313121218124431212F w 21122 1F w 1 w4 F w1Note that when firm i offers the highest possible wage in the market it fails to hire a worker withprobability 381. Setting w w yields equilibrium profits: iw 4381 1 w . Let w denote theupper bound of the wage distribution. In a mixed strategy equilibrium, the firm must be indifferentbetween offering any wage in w, w so F w must solve: 43813581F w 1 w 43811 wwhich yields 4. Setting F w 1 and solving for w one finds the upper bound of the wagedistribution.Let E1, E2, E3 denote the expected maximum wage from a sample of size 1, 2, and 3, respectively.15 The expected payoff to a worker in equilibrium is given by:U ea 2 86162E1 35162E2 2kwhere 86162 is the probability that the worker receives just one job offer and 35162 is theprobability that heshe gets two job offers. We note that a worker gets no job with a probabilityequal to 41162.In equilibrium, a worker must obtain nonnegative expected utility, which yields the condition:and there should be no profitable upward or downward deviation. The expected utility for a deviantk 20 86324E1 35324E23115 For a given wage distribution F w, the expected maximum wage from a random sample of size n is En cid:85 n F wn 1fwdw.43who sends 3 applications is given by U ed ad 3 69162E1 60162E2 15162E3 3kwhere 69162 is the probability that the worker receives just one job offer, 60162 is the probabilitythat heshe gets two wage offers and 15162 is the probability heshe receives three offers. We notethat in this case the probability the worker remains unemployed is 18162. Deviating to a 3 isnot profitable if U ea 2 U ek 23 d ad 3, or:2516216162E1 E2 15162E332Next, we have to establish when it is not profitable to deviate to a 1. Consider a worker whodeviates and sends out just one application. The expected utility is P 0 off ers 19 2323122323121212U ed a 1 1327E1 k 0 1427where 1327 is the probability of getting employed. Deviating to a 1 is not profitable if:d ad 1 or:U ea 2 U e 357k 21 162162E1 E233We note that 20 21 so the condition 33 is implied by condition 31. So it must be the casethat 20 k 23 for an equilibrium with a 2 to exist.We finally consider the case where each worker sends 3 applications. The payoff to a firm offeringa wage w when the rivals offer a random draw from F w is calculated as follows. First, note thatfirm i picks a worker at random and makes an offer to himher. The firm hires this worker surelywhen the other two firms offer their vacancy to different workers, i.e., with probability 232.Second, with probability 21323 at least one other firm offers its job to the worker of firmi, in which case firm i only hires if its wage is higher, i.e., with probability F w. Finally, withprobability 132 both other firms offer their job to the candidate of firm i, in which case firm ionly hires with probability F w2. This leads to the following payoff:iw; F w 19F 2w 49F w 49 1 wSolving the equation iw; F w iw yields the distribution function provided in the text.Setting F w 1 and solving for w yields w 5 4w9.To calculate the expected payoff for a worker when a 3, note that we can think of this processas each firm applying to 1 worker so the number of offers a worker gets is binv, 1receives three offers with probability 133, two offers with probability 313223, one offer withprobability 313232.and no offer with probability 233. As a result,u. The worker U ea 3 49E1 29E2 127E3 3k 44In equilibrium, a worker must obtain nonnegative expected utility, which yields the conditionk 30 427E1 227E2 181E3.34In addition, there should be no profitable downward deviation. The expected utility for a deviantwho sends just 2 applications is calculated taking into account that the worker gets one offer withprobability 21323 and two offers with chance 132. We note that the worker receives nooffer with probability 232. This yields a payoff Deviating to a 2 is not profitable if:U ed ad 2 49E1 19E2 2kd ad 2 or:U ea 3 U e 1k 32 9E2 127E3.Deviation to a 1 is not profitable provided that U ea 3 U ed ad 1 2 121k 31 9E1 913E1 k or:E3 .E2 1273536We note that 32 31 30 so the condition 35 implies conditions 34 and 36.D Proof Corollary 1To prove that the expected wage is initially increasing in a for all parameters, we evaluate 13 ata 2. This yieldsd Ewda a2dzz EwEwa a2da a2y 3 1z,2 1 wZ 102 z,2 1 z, 2 1 z, 21 y logh1 z, 21 y21z,21z,21yidy.Note that the denominator of the integrand of this expression is positive, for all y.Now we showthat the numerator is also positive, for all y. That is, we need to show that 1 z 1 z zy log 1 z 1 z zy y z 1 z 2 37for all y, where we have suppressed the arguments of z to save on notation. Notice that 37 holds 1zzyi , whilefor y 0. Moreover, the LHS of 37 increases in y at a rate z 1 z31 logh 1z 1zzyi . Now we note that z 1 z31 logh 1zthe RHS does so at a constant rate 1z 2 zz 1 z 1 log1 z z 2 , for all , where the last inequality can be easily plotted in using the expression for z, 2 given above. Thus, the expected wage increases in the number of 1z 45applications in a neighborhood of a 2, for all .We now prove that if is sufficiently large, the expected wage is increasing in the number ofapplications a. We can rewrite 13 in the following way:d Ewda 1wZ 101 za 11 z1 yaa 1y A 1a ! 1 z1 y loga 11e a 1 z1 y dy.1 z Notice that the sign of this derivative depends on the sign of the term between square brackets.The LHS of that term is negative, decreases as increases and converges to 1a as while its RHS is positive, increases in and converges to infinity as . As a result there exists e suchthat for all e, the sign of this derivative is positive. The proof is now complete. 46", "filename": "04-063.pdf", "person": ["Pieter A.
