IZA Discussion Paper No. 4993 June 2010 ABSTRACT Quantile Treatment Effects in the Regression Discontinuity Design: Process Results and Gini Coefficient This paper shows nonparametric identification of quantile treatment effects QTE in the regression discontinuity design. The distributional impacts of social programs such as welfare, education, training programs and unemployment insurance are of large interest to economists. QTE are an intuitive tool to characterize the effects of these interventions on the outcome distribution. We propose uniformly consistent estimators for both potential outcome distributions treated and nontreated for the population of interest as well as other functionvalued effects of the policy including in particular the QTE process. The estimators are straightforward to implement and attain the optimal rate of convergence for onedimensional nonparametric regression. We apply the proposed estimators to estimate the effects of summer school on the distribution of school grades, complementing the results of Jacob and Lefgren 2004.

Theprediction made by Campbell and Stanley 1963 that the RDD is cid:147very limited in its range ofapplications that are mainly educationalcid:148 has been proven wrong by the recent literature. The RDD has received tremendous attention in many cid:133elds, e.g.health, criminology, environment, development.1labor markets, political economy The RDD has attracted a more modest attention in theoretical econometrics. Hahn, Todd, andvan der Klaauw 2001 describe this identicid:133cation strategy using the treatment eect frameworkand formalize the assumptions required to identify causal eects. They also provide local linearestimators to nonparametrically estimate the mean treatment eect. Porter 2003 complementstheir work by considering alternative estimators. Lee and Card 2008 consider the case whenthe forcing variable is discrete. They interpret deviations of the true regression function from agiven approximating function as specicid:133cation errors and propose appropriately corrected standarderrors. Mc Crary 2008 develops a test of the manipulation of the running variable related to thecontinuity of its density function. Frcid:246lich 2007 incorporates covariates in a fully nonparametricway and shows that e ciency gains are obtained and that the rate of convergence does not dependon the number of covariates. Imbens and Lemieux 2008, van der Klaauw 2008 and Lee and Lemieux 2009 have surveyed both the applied and theoretical literature on the RDD.Despite this growing number of studies, the RDD has been used so far only to estimate averagetreatment eects. Yet, in many research areas, one is often not only interested in average impacts,but also in the distributional consequences of treatment interventions. In the cid:133eld of educatione.g. Jacob and Lefgren 2004, Leuven, Lindahl, Oosterbeek, and Webbink 2007, educationalinequality e.g.in cognitive achievement is of large public interest. When examining the eects 1 For an incomplete list see e.g. Angrist and Lavy 1999, Battistin and Rettore 2002, Battistin and Rettore2008, Black 1999, Black, Galdo, and Smith 2007, Black, Jang, and Kim 2006, Black, Smith, Berger, and Noel 2003, Buddelmeyer and Skoucid:133as 2003, Brcid:252gger, Lalive, and Zweimcid:252ller 2008, Chay and Greenstone2005, Chay, Mc Ewan, and Urquiola 2005, Di Nardo and Lee 2004, Fredriksson and cid:214ckert 2006, Forslundand Skans 2006, Imbens and Lemieux 2008, Gormley and Phillips 2005, Guryan 2001, Jepsen, Mueser, and Troske 2009, Lalive 2008, Lalive, Wcid:252llrich, and Zweimcid:252ller 2008, Leuven, Lindahl, Oosterbeek, and Webbink2007, Matsudaira 2008, Nordstrcid:246m Skans and Lindqvist 2005, cid:214ckert 2008, Puhani and Weber 2007, van der Klaauw 2002, van der Klaauw 2008 and the special issue of the Journal of Econometrics 2008.1of training e.g. Black, Galdo, and Smith 2007, policy makers are often more interested inthe eects at the lower quantiles than at the upper quantiles. When analyzing the eects ofunemployment insurance on unemployment durations e.g. Lalive 2008, the distribution of theunemployment durations is of interest, e.g. the risk of becoming longterm unemployed.In this paper we identify and estimate nonparametrically the treatment eects on the distribution of the outcome variable in the RDD.2 We obtain uniformly consistent estimates for thedistribution functions of the potential outcomes. If the dependent variable is continuous, quantiletreatment eects QTE are a convenient way to report heterogeneous impacts of treatments ondierent points of an outcome distribution. Therefore, we show how quantile treatment eectscan also be identicid:133ed and estimated. More generally, we obtain uniformly consistent estimates forfunctionals of the distribution functions, e.g. for the Gini coe cient, the Lorenz curve or distribution treatment eects.3 Our estimators are based on the locallinear estimation of the distributionfunction. If we choose optimally the bandwidth, our estimators are consistent at the ncid:0 2which is the optimal convergence rate for onedimensional nonparametric estimation.5 rate,Even if one is not primarily interested in the distributional impacts or the impact on inequality,one may still use the method proposed to reduce susceptibility to outliers. Compared to the widelyused mean RDD estimator, a median RDD estimator can provide more stable estimates when theoutcome variable is noisy, e.g. wages or earnings. The quantiles are welldecid:133ned even if theoutcome variable does not have cid:133nite moments due to fat tails. This is akin to the discussion onmean versus median regression, see e.g. Koenker and Bassett 1978 and Koenker 2005, whostress the robustness of median regression to outliers. This may be particularly relevant for the 2 The identicid:133cation of the distribution of the potential outcomes was cid:133rst shown in section 4.3 of Frcid:246lich 2007.These results were extended in the IZA working paper 3638 that was released in August 2008. The present papersupplants this working paper and our previous results. Frandsen 2009 has proposed an estimator based on ouridenticid:133cation strategy using local linear quantile regression. Frandsencid:146s estimator is dierent from ours in manyways. However, it is ine cient compared to our estimator. It does not achieve the optimal convergence rate ofncid:0 25 . See his Assumption A7. Guiteras 2008 suggests an interesting alternative identicid:133cation strategy based on Chernozhukov and Hansen 2005. His assumptions are neither more nor less general than ours. However, we viewhis assumptions as less natural in the RDD. His identicid:133cation approach relies on a monotonicity assumption in theoutcome equation, whereas we rely on a monotonicity assumption in the selection equation, which appears naturalin the RDD. His approach is only applicable for a continuous outcome variable Y , whereas we can allow for Y tobe discrete, continuous or mixed discretecontinuous, e.g. earnings with a mass point at zero.3 We proceed in this respect as in Chernozhukov, FernndezVal, and Melly 2007. For a further discussion oninequality measures see also Firpo 2008.2RDD since the number of observations close to the discontinuity threshold is often relatively small.In many applications, estimated eects on highereducation or employment are often signicid:133cantwhereas eects on earnings or wages are insignicid:133cant, because of the large variance of the latterestimates, see e.g. Jepsen, Mueser, and Troske 2009.The results in this paper are related to previous eorts to estimate quantile treatment eects.Koenker and Bassett 1978 propose a parametric estimator for conditional quantile functionswhile Chaudhuri 1991 suggests a nonparametric estimator. In the RDD, the QTEs could beestimated via nonparametrically weighted quantile regressions. However, we prefer to estimatecid:133rst the distribution function because the weights can be negative in the RDD, which causes theobjective function to be nonconvex.In the fuzzy discontinuity design the proposed estimatorcan be interpreted as an instrumental variable estimator where the discontinuity is used as abinary instrument for the binary treatment. This is similar to the framework of Abadie, Angrist,and Imbens 2002 and Abadie 2003 with the added complication that we must controlnonparametrically for the continuous running variable.We illustrate how our estimators work in practice by applying the methodology to the dataused by Jacob and Lefgren 2004. They exploit an administrative rule introduced by Chicagopublic schools in 1996 that tied summer school attendance to accomplishment on tests. Using thediscontinuity implied by this rule they cid:133nd positive mean eects of the summer school on latereducational achievement. We complement their results by showing that the eects were clearlylarger at the upper quantile than at the lower quantiles of the test score distribution. This showsthat summer school is particularly eective for motivated students who have presently di culties.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2 identicid:133cation is considered. Section 3 proposes estimators and derives their limiting distributions. We extend the previous results tothe case where covariates are present in section 4. Section 5 applies the estimation and inferenceprocedures to estimate distributional eects of summer school on educational attainment. Section 6 concludes with a summary of the results.32 Identicid:133cation of QTE in the RDDWe decid:133ne causal eects using the potentialoutcome notation in the framework known as the NeymanFisherRubin causal model.4 We are interested in the eect of a binary treatment D onan outcome variable Y . We observe n units, indexed by i 1; :::; n, which are drawn randomlyand independently from a large population. Let Y 1i and Y 0i. Hence, Y 1i would be realized if individual i were to receive treatment and Y 0otherwise. The potential outcomes as well as the treatment eects Y 1i be the potential outcomes of individuali would be realizedi are permitted to varyi cid:0 Y 0freely across individuals, i.e. no constant treatment eect is assumed.We observe each unit only once and, therefore, observe the realized outcome Yi Y 0i 1 cid:0 DiY 1i Di but not both potential outcomes. The identicid:133cation strategy of the causal treatment eects In thewill exploit the presence of Zi, a variable that incid:135uences Di in a discontinuous way.example in Section 5, Zi will be performance on a test before the summer break. Note that Z isnot an instrument because it is allowed to have a direct eect on Y . However, this direct impact isassumed to be cid:146smoothcid:146while the eect on D is assumed to be discontinuous at a known thresholdz 0.In the literature, two dierent designs are often examined. In the sharp design Di changes foreveryone at z 0,Di 1Zi cid:21 z 0.1In this sharp design, all individuals change programme participation status exactly at z 0. In manyapplications, however, the treatment decision contains some element of discretion. Caseworkersmay have some discretion about whom they oer a programme, or they may base their decisionalso on criteria that are unobserved to the econometrician. In this case, known as the fuzzy design,D is permitted to also depend on other unobserved factors but we assume that the treatmentprobability changes discontinuously at z 0:lim!0E Dj Z z 0 cid:0 lim!0E Dj Z z 0 cid:0 6 0.2The fuzzy design includes the sharp design as a special case when the left hand side of 2 is equalto one. Therefore the following discussion focusses on the more general fuzzy design.54 See Neyman 1935, Fisher 1935 and Rubin 1978.5 Battistin and Rettore 2008 introduce the mixed sharp fuzzy design as a special case of the fuzzy design.4In addition to the discontinuity 2, which is in fact a testable assumption, for identicid:133cationit is further required that the conditional means of EY 0j Z and EY 1j Z are continuous at z 0.With these two assumptions, Z can act as an instrumental variable locally in a neighbourhoodabout z 0.6 Since we allow for heterogenous treatment eects, identicid:133cation requires further amonotonicity condition similar to that of Imbens and Angrist 1994. We identify the causaleects of D on the distribution of Y for the local compliers. Note that in the sharp design themonotonicity assumption is automatically satiscid:133ed and everyone is a complier.For stating the identicid:133cation results, it is helpful to introduce more precise notation cid:133rst. Let N be a symmetric neighborhood about z 0 and partition N into N fz : z cid:21 z 0; z 2 Ngand N cid:0 fz : z z 0; z 2 Ng. According to their reaction to the instrument z over N we canpartition the population into cid:133ve subpopulations:Ti; a Ti; n Ti; c Ti; d Ti; indififififif Diz 1 8z 2 N cid:0Diz 0 8z 2 N cid:0Diz 0 8z 2 N cid:0Diz 1 8z 2 N cid:0Diz is nonconstant over N cid:0 or over N .and Diz 1 8z 2 N and Diz 0 8z 2 N and Diz 1 8z 2 N and Diz 0 8z 2 N The decid:133nition of these subpopulations is a direct extension of the concept of Imbens and Angrist1994. The cid:133rst group contains those units that will always be treated if Z 2 N, the secondcontains those that will never be treated if Z 2 N, and the third and fourth group containsthe units that are treated only on one side of z 0. The cid:133fth group labelled indecid:133nite contains allunits that react nonmonotonously over the N neighbourhood, e.g. they may cid:133rst switch from D 0 to 1 and then back for increasing values of z. We will assume that the last two groupshave measure zero for su ciently small. Note that in the sharp design, everyone is a complierfor any 0.Assumption I: There exists some arbitrary positive cid:22 such that for every positive cid:20 cid:226 Hahn, Todd, and van der Klaauw 2001 consider also as an alternative a kind of selection on observablesassumption. They assume that the treatment eect is independent of D conditional on Z being near z 0. We focuson the IV type approach because it seems to dominate the literature. In the sharp design, both assumptions areequivalent. In any case, in both designs the same estimator is obtained whichever of the two assumptions is invoked.5i Existence of compliersii Monotonicityiii Independent IViv IV Exclusionv Density at thresholdfor t 2 fd; indg PrT cj Z z 0 0Pr T tj Z 2 N 0Pr T tj Z 2 N FY 1j Z2N FY 0j Z2N lim!0lim!0lim!0 ;Ttu cid:0 FY 1j Z2N cid:0 ;Ttu 0lim!0 ;Ttu cid:0 FY 0j Z2N cid:0 ;Ttu 0lim!0FZz is dierentiable at z 0 and f Zz 0 0 cid:0 Pr T tj Z 2 N cid:0 0for t 2 fa; n; cgfor t 2 fa; cgfor t 2 fn; cg This assumption requires that for every smallenough neigbourhood, the threshold acts like alocal instrumental variable. Assumption I i requires that E Dj Z is in fact discontinuous at z 0,i.e. we assume that some units change their treatment status exactly at z 0. Assumption I iirequires that, in a very small neighborhood of z 0, the instrument has a weakly monotonous impacton Diz. Assumptions I iii and iv impose the continuity of the type and the distribution ofthe potential outcomes as a function of Z at z 0.7 Assumption I v requires that observationsclose to z 0 exist.Under this assumption the distribution functions of the potential outcomes for local compliers FY dj Z2N;Tcu.

Details of the estimator will be discussed in the next section.Note that in the sharp design, everyone is a complier at z 0, such that the cdf of the potentialoutcomes in the population is identicid:133ed in this case as E 1 Y cid:20 uj Z 2 N; D 1E 1 Y cid:20 uj Z 2 N; D 0 .7 This is slightly weaker than assuming Y 1; Y 0;T??1 Z cid:21 z 0j Z 2 N for ! 0.FY 1u lim!0FY 0u lim!06The previous theorem showed that the distribution functions are identicid:133ed irrespective ofwhether the outcome variable Y is continuous or discrete.Identicid:133cation of the distributionfunction also implies the identicid:133cation of all functionals of the marginal distribution functionof the outcome with and without the treatment. We provide detailed results for a popularfunctional, the quantile treatment eect QTE process, but similar results may be obtained forother functionals such as the variance, the Gini coe cient, the Lorenz curve, the Theil index orthe interquartile or interdecile range. These results can also be used to develop tests of cid:133rst orsecond order stochastic dominance.When Y is continuously distributed, we are often interested in the quantiles of the potentialoutcomes and in particular the quantile treatment eect. Suppose that Y 1, Y 0 are continuouslydistributed which implies that the distribution functions are monotonously increasing and invertible. Let Qcid:28Y dj Z2N;Tcas the cid:28 th quantile of Y d for the local compliers. The quantile treatment eect QTE for the Y inffu : FY u cid:21 cid:28g be the quantile operator.

A more direct approach to identify andestimate QTE consists in using the representation of conditional quantiles as the solution to aminimization problem, as in Koenker and Bassett 1978. The following result gives a directrepresentation of the quantiles and of the cid:1cid:28QT E. The expressions are obtained via the cid:133rst orderconditions of a minimizationmaximization problem.Theorem 2 Quantiles of the potential outcomes Under Assumption I and assuming that Y 0 and Y 1 are continuously distributed, the quantiles of the potential outcomes for the local compliers are identicid:133ed as Qcid:28Y 1jc lim!0Qcid:28Y 0jc lim!0arg minarg minwhere cid:26cid:28 u u cid:1 fcid:28 cid:0 1 u 0g is the check function and p Pr Z cid:21 z 0j Z 2 N for 0.qq Ecid:2cid:26cid:28 Y cid:0 qcid:0I cid:0 pcid:1j Z 2 N; D 1cid:3Ecid:2cid:26cid:28 Y cid:0 qcid:0p cid:0 I cid:1j Z 2 N; D 0cid:3 ,7Alternatively, we could identify the QTE cid:1cid:28QT E directly ascid:16Qcid:28Y 0jc; cid:1cid:28QT Ecid:17 lim!0arg mina;b Ecid:2cid:26cid:28 Y cid:0 a cid:0 b Dcid:0I cid:0 pcid:1 2D cid:0 1j Z 2 Ncid:3 ,which corresponds to a local weighted bivariate quantile regression.3Hence, the quantiles can be obtained by simple univariate weighted quantile regressions. Despite its simplicity one should note that the objective function of the weighted quantile regressionestimator is not convex since some of the weights are negative. Conventional linear programmingalgorithms therefore will not work. Implementation via estimation of the cdf, as identicid:133ed by Theorem 1, with subsequent inversion to obtain the quantiles is more convenient in practice. This isthe way how we implement the estimator in Section 3.Before we discuss estimation of the cdf and the QTE in more detail, we note that the previousexpressions can be simplicid:133ed considerably.

We also derive asymptotic resultsfor these processes.We cid:133rst examine the estimator of the distribution function of the potential outcomes, whichhas the advantage that it applies naturally irrespective of whether Y is continuous or discrete.For example, when one considers earnings, there is usually a substantial masspoint at zero, whichdoes not pose any problems when estimating the cdf.A natural estimator of FY 1jc following from Theorem 1 can be motivated as follows. Let Ki besome kernel weights depending on the distance between Zi and z 0 and a bandwidth converging tozero. We permit the weights to be local linear regression weights and will be more specicid:133c furtherbelow. A natural estimator of FY 1jcu is thusi cid:0 pcid:1 Kiwhere a natural estimator of p is P I i KiP Ki. We thus obtain after a few calculations Pi:IPi:IPi:IFY 1jcu P 1 Yi cid:20 u Dicid:0I P Dicid:0I i cid:0 pcid:1 Ki Pi:IPi:IPi:IPi:I1Yicid:20uDi Ki 1Yicid:20uDi Ki Ki cid:0Pi:Ii Di Ki Di Kicid:01i Ki0Ki1i0i0i Ki0i.1i1i Decid:133ne for a general random variable W the following right limit function mE Wj Z z 0 and the corresponding left limit function mcid:0W lim E Wj Z z 0 cid:0 .

In this case, the number of data points could be asymmetric around z 0, and we couldobtain more precise estimates by estimating the probability p for a given . In some sense this result appears to berelated to the wellknown result in the propensity score matching literature that estimators which use the estimatedpropensity score are more e cient than estimators that use the true propensity score. Those results, however, arenot directly transferable here, since we are in a nonparametric context. We plan to discuss this issue in future workand will consider only estimators that use an estimated p in this paper.9arg mina;bWi cid:0 a cid:0 b Zi cid:0 z 02 cid:1 I n Xi1h cid:19 .i Kcid:18 Zi cid:0 z 0and similarly for the nontreated outcomeFY 0jcu m1Y cid:20u1cid:0D cid:0 mcid:01Y cid:20u1cid:0Dm1cid:0D cid:0 mcid:01cid:0D.If we use local linear weights, which appears appropriate here since we are eectively estimatingconditional means at boundary points from the left and right of z 0, mof a that solves W is estimated as the value Analogously mcid:0W is estimated by using only observations to the left of z 0.Before we can state the main asymptotic results, we have to decid:133ne precisely the regularityconditions that we assume.Assumption Ri IID sampling: The data fYi; Di; Zig are iidii Smoothness and limit conditions: The left and right limits of the functions E 1 Y cid:20 uj Z; D 0,E 1 Y cid:20 uj Z; D 1 and E Dj Z exist at z 0 and these functions are twice continuouslydierentiable with respect to Z at z 0 with second derivative Hcid:246lder continuous in a left and aright neighborhood of z 0, respectively, and uniformly on y 2 Y, where Y is a compact subset of R.iii Density: The density f Z is bounded away from zero and is twice continuously dierentiableat z 0 with second derivative Hcid:246lder continuous in a neighborhood of z 0.iv Compliers: The fraction of compliers Pc mv Bandwidth conditions: nh ! 1 and pnhh 2 ! cid:4 1.D cid:0 mcid:0D is bounded away from zero.vi Kernel: K is symmetric, bounded, zero outside a compact set and integrates to one.Assumption R i is made mainly for simplicity and because it is satiscid:133ed in most applicationsof the RDD. Assumption R ii assures su cient smoothness on both sides of the threshold. Itguarantees that the distribution functions are equicontinuous in a neighborhood of z 0. Note thatassumption R ii implies also the existence of the left and right limits of all covariance functionssince the random variables 1 Y cid:20 u and D are all binary. Condition R iv is equivalent toassuming that we have a strong instrument in an IV problem. Condition R v balances bias andvariance of the estimator. For cid:4 0, squared bias and variance are of the same order. If wechoose a bandwidth such that cid:4 0, the bias vanishes asymptotically. To simplify the notation,10the same bandwidth is used for all functions on both sides of the threshold. The results can beadapted to allow for dierent bandwidths in a straightforward way as long as the convergencerates of the bandwidths are the same.

A disadvantage of consideringquantiles is that they have a welldecid:133ned asymptotic distribution only if the outcome is continuous.We therefore make the additional Assumption Q from now on.Assumption Q: FY 0jc u and FY 1jc u are both continuously dierentiable with continuousdensity functions f Y 0jc u and f Y 1jc u that are bounded above and away from zero on Y.We could estimate the quantile treatment eects by the sample analog of Theorem 2. Thisminimization problem is, however, a nonconvex optimization problem because some weightsare positive while others are negative. This requires grid searches or algorithms for nonconvexproblems that do not guarantee a global optimum.11 Therefore, we follow a more direct strategy 11 Abadie, Angrist, and Imbens 2002 encountered a similar problem and they proposed to convexify the problemby using the projection of the weights on the space spanned by D, X and Y . This requires an additional nonparametric regression and it is unclear if this additional step will preserve the asymptotic distribution of the estimator.Our setup is simpler as we would not need to project on X.12here and invert the estimated distribution function. Another consequence of having negativeFY jjc umay decrease when we increase u. Of course, this is only a small sample problem because theand positive weights is that the estimated distribution function is nonmonotone:assumed monotonicity ensures that the estimated distribution function is asymptotically strictlyincreasing. Even being only a small sample problem, this is nevertheless disadvantageous ifone wants to invert FY jjc u. We follow here the suggestion of Chernozhukov, FernandezVal,and Galichon 2007 and monotonize the estimated distribution functions by rearrangements.This does not aect the asymptotic properties of the estimator but allows us to invert it. Thisprocedure consists of a sequence of closedform steps and is therefore very quick.We now derive the limiting distribution of the quantile functions and of other functionalsof the distribution functions via the functional delta method see chapter 3.9 in van der Vaartand Wellner 1996. This requires establishing the Hadamard dierentiability of the functionals,which is well known in the case of the quantile functions.12Theorem 7 Limit distribution for quantile functions If assumptions I, R and Q are satiscid:133ed, the estimators QY 0jc cid:28 and QY 1jc cid:28 of the quantile functions for the compliers QY 0jc cid:28 and QY 1jc cid:28 jointly converge to the following Gaussian processes:pnhncid:16 QY jjc cid:28 cid:0 QY jjc cid:28 cid:17 cid:0f Y jjccid:0QY jjc cid:28 cid:1cid:01 Zjcid:0QY jjc cid:28 cid:1 : W j cid:28 ,vj;kcid:16QY jjc cid:28 ; QY kjc cid:28 cid:17.j;k cid:28 ; cid:28 f Y jjccid:0QY jjc cid:28 cid:1cid:01 f Y kjccid:16QY kjc cid:28 cid:17cid:01j cid:28 cid:0f Y jjccid:0QY jjc cid:28 cid:1cid:01 bjcid:0QY jjc cid:28 cid:1 and covariance funcin 10; 1 with mean function bqtion vqj 2 f 0; 1g The straightforward Corollary 8 gives the limiting distribution of the quantile treatment effect process.

Frcid:246lich2007 discusses in detail why one might want to control for X. Even if we believe that the RDDis valid without conditioning, we might want to check for the robustness of the results when weinclude covariates. In addition, Frcid:246lich 2007 shows that including covariates will increase theprecision of the estimates.13In other cases, the variable Z itself may be confounded, e.g.ina situation of dynamic treatment assignment as in van der Klaauw 2008. Another reason forincorporating covariates applies when the threshold crossing at z 0 itself aects various X variablesthat one would like to control for. Under certain conditions we can disentangle the direct fromthe indirect eects by controlling for X. See e.g. Brcid:252gger, Lalive, and Zweimcid:252ller 2008.Whatever reasoning is used to justify the inclusion of covariates, we assume in the followingthat Assumption I holds conditionally on X. Note that we permit that, when not conditioningon X, Assumption I may or may not be valid. The identicid:133cation results stated above nowapply immediately to the treatment eect conditionally on X. In many situations we are howevermore interested in the unconditional eect, i.e. the eect for all compliers irrespective of theirvalue of X. There are at least three reasons why unconditional eects are interesting. First, forthe purpose of evidencebased policy making a small number of summary measures can be moreeasily conveyed to the policy makers and the public than a large number of estimated eects foreach and every value of X. Second, unconditional eects can be estimated more precisely thanconditional eects.14 Third, the decid:133nition of the unconditional eects does not depend on the 13 This has been shown only for average eects. We will analyze this issue in more detail in future work for QTE.14 Unless one imposes parametric assumptions.15variables included in X.15 One can therefore consider dierent sets of control variables X andstill estimate the same object, which is useful for examining robustness of the results to the set ofcontrol variables.The following results identify the unconditional eects, which are obtained by cid:133rst conditioningon X and thereafter integrating with respect to X. For identicid:133cation we need a common supportrestriction with respect to X.Assumption C: Suppose Assumption I i, ii and v. Suppose further that Assumption I iiiand iv are true conditionally on X. Further assume:vi Common supportlim!0SuppXj Z 2 N lim!0SuppXj Z 2 N cid:0 With this assumption, we can identify the quantile and cumulative distribution functions ofthe potential outcomes for all compliers. Similar expressions as in Theorems 1 and 2 are obtainedbut the weights are now a function of px Pr Z cid:21 z 0j X x; Z 2 N. The following Theorem 10 shows the results for the QTEs.Theorem 10 Identicid:133cation of QTEs in the presence of covariates Under Assumption C,cid:16Qcid:28Y 0jc; cid:1cid:28QT Ecid:17 lim!0arg mina;b Ecid:20cid:26cid:28 Y cid:0 a cid:0 b DI cid:0 pXpX 1 cid:0 pX2D cid:0 1j Z 2 Ncid:21 .This result shows that the unconditional QTE can be estimated via a simple weighted quantileregression where the covariates X only enter in the weights via px.1617 Again, the weights inthe previous expression are sometimes positive and sometimes negative such that conventionallinear programming algorithms fail because of the nonconvexity. In the application we will therefore again proceed by cid:133rst estimating the entire distribution functions and thereafter obtain thequantiles via inversion. The results for the distribution functions are given in the appendix.15 This, of course, is only true if X contains only pretreatment variables.16 Note that these weights are similar to the weights in Theorems 3.1 b and c of Abadie 2003. The weightsused here, however, are localized with respect to z 0. The nonparametric setup of the RDD requires smoothing withrespect to Z. Therefore none of the conditions of Abadie 2003 is satiscid:133ed in our local nonparametric framework.This also implies that we cannot obtain a parametric rate of convergence as discussed before.17 Hirano, Imbens, and Ridder 2003 also use a weighting approach in a setup where treatment is unconfoundedgiven X.165 Application: eects of summer school attendance In this section, we apply the methods proposed earlier to estimate the eects of a summer schoolprogram for weak students on academic achievement. We use administrative data from the Chicago Public School system, taken from Jacob and Lefgren 2004.18 We use the same identicid:133cationstrategy as in this incid:135uential article but consider the eects of the summer school on the entiredistribution of test scores. While Jacob and Lefgren 2004 acknowledge the interest in quantiletreatment eects p. 233, they estimate only average eects due to the absence, at that time, ofsuitable methods for quantiles and distributions.The regression discontinuity design follows from an administrative rule that tied summer schoolattendance to the performance on a standardized test.In 1996, the Chicago Public Schoolsrequired students in third, sixth and eighth grade to take a mathematics and a reading exam in June. Students who did not meet the standards at both tests were required to attend a sixweekssummer school. This discontinuity in the rule can be used to identify the eect of the summerschool attendance on similar tests one and two years after the summer school. More details canbe found in the original article Jacob and Lefgren 2004.We focus on students for whom the reading cuto was binding that is, students who passedmath because many more students failed in reading than in mathematics. For this sample, thereading test score is the unique running variable and this situation corresponds exactly to ourframework. With two tests math and reading, two grades third and sixth and two periodsone and two years after the summer school, we could consider eight outcome variables. Due tospace limitations, we provide detailed results for the math test score one year after the summerschool for the third graders. We focus on this outcome for two reasons. First, the treatment eectsare estimated most precisely for this outcome variable in Jacob and Lefgren 2004. Second, thesupport of this outcome variable comprises so many values that it can reasonably be treated asa continuous variable. The results for other outcomes will be briecid:135y sketched at the end of thissection.The administrative rule suggests a sharp discontinuity. However, some course waivers weregiven and a small percentage of students who scored above the threshold were observed participating. This fuzziness of the selection rule does not preclude the identicid:133cation of the treatment effects for the subpopulation of compliers as discussed in Section 2. Figure 1 shows the relationship 18 We thank Brian Jacob and Lars Lefgren for supporting us in accessing their data.17between the reading test score the running variable Z and the treatment probability. The discontinuity is extremely clear and compliers represent about 90% of the population at the threshold.Figure 1 shows also three quantiles of the outcome variable as a function of the running variable Z. If the summer school attendance had no eect, we would not observe any discontinuity in therelationship between the running variable Z and the outcome at the threshold. Yet, we canrecognize a drop in the conditional 95th percentile 3.5, median 2.8 and 5th percentile 1.3exactly at the threshold. While these drops suggest that the treatment had a positive eect, theincreasing size of the drops suggests that the eects were stronger at the top of the distribution.Note, however, that the dierences between the quantiles above and below the threshold do notestimate the quantile treatment eects in the fuzzy discontinuity design. Therefore, we presentnow the results obtained using the consistent estimators suggested in this paper.The implementation of the estimators requires choosing the bandwidth and the kernel function.The choice of the kernel function is typically considered as being not very crucial. We have usedthe Epanechnikov kernel but the robustness checks with the uniform kernel as in Jacob and Lefgren 2004 do not reveal any sensitivity. For the bandwidth, we use the same bandwidthas in the original article.19 This can be considered as a conservative choice since onesided crossvalidation gives larger bandwidths. When using the larger bandwidths, the estimated quantiletreatment eects are similar but estimated with a smaller variance. From now on, we will use asoutcome variable the math test achievement gains instead of the math tests themselves in order tobe more in line with the analysis of Jacob and Lefgren 2004. This does not aect the results verymuch since we estimate the eects only for the population with reading score in a neighbourhoodof z 0, where also the pretreatment math score is balanced between left and right.Figure 2 plots the estimated distribution functions of the potential outcomes FY 1jc and FY 0jctogether with pointwise 95% concid:133dence intervals based on Theorem 5. At the lower end ofthe distribution, FY 1jc and FY 0jc are rather similar, but they diverge at the upper end of thedistribution. The two concid:133dence intervals do not overlap over a large part of the distribution.Figure 2 also reveals that the distribution of the outcome variable can be considered as reasonably smooth. This allows inverting the distribution functions and estimating the quantile treat19 Actually, Jacob and Lefgren 2004 use a dierent bandwidth on the left 2 and on the right 4. We use thesame bandwidth 2 on both sides.18ment eect process. Figure 3 plots the estimated quantile treatment eects with pointwise 95%concid:133dence intervals. This concid:133rms the visual impression obtained from the distribution functionsof Figure 2: the eect of summer school attendance is small or perhaps even negative at the bottom and increases monotonically when we move up the distribution. Note that the QTEs estimated at dierent quantiles are positively correlated. This means that the dierences betweentwo QTEs may be signicid:133cant even when the concid:133dence intervals overlap. In fact, we reject at the 3% level the equality between the 0.9 and 0.1 QTEs or between the 0.1, 0.25, 0.75 and 0.9 QTEs,for instance.Some caution must be exercised when interpreting these results, because of the population forwhich they are identicid:133ed. We cannot simply interpret the quantile as unobserved ability sinceall students had the same test score before the summer school. Conditionally on being relativelymediocre at the cid:133rst test, the best students benecid:133ted the most from attending the summer school.We interpret the unobserved heterogeneity more like a measure of motivation: motivated studentsbenecid:133ted from being helped during the summer while unmotivated students did not gain anythingfrom additional school hours. Students who do not like going to school will not progress whenmore school is being imposed. On the other hand, interested students who suered from a lack ofresources and support at home could benecid:133t from this additional support. In light of these results,the summer school cannot be considered as a panacea, but it was eective for the majority of thestudents.20Figure 4 provides an alternative visualization of the results which might facilitate interpretation. It shows the estimated density functions of the potential outcomes, f Y 1jc and f Y 0jc, obtainedfrom the distribution functions of Figure 2. This graph shows very clearly that, for the populationof compliers who scored close to the threshold z 0, summer school leads not only to a rightwardshift but also to a widening of the test distribution. Many students gain from summer school, butclearly not everyone, and some may even be harmed by attending summer school.2120 Note that the students who attended the summer school have also taken a test in August. If their score wasgood enough, they were allowed to advance. If their score was still too low, they were retained. We do not try toidentify separately the eect of grade retention. Our results represent the total eect of summer school participationand potential grade retention. We do not believe that the heterogeneity of the eects is driven by grade retentionbecause the weakest students were retained and Jacob and Lefgren 2004 cid:133nd a positive eect for grade retention.21 We do not require a rank invariance assumption as in Chernozhukov and Hansen 2005 or Guiteras 2008. Wetherefore identify only the marginal distributions. Figures 3 and 4 only show that most quantiles move upwards,yet individual treatment eects could still be negative for many students.19In our analysis so far, we have not included any control variables. Jacob and Lefgren 2004 infact include two year dummies in their main specicid:133cation and 23 other additional control variablesfor their robustness checks. The main goal of this exercise is to check indirectly the validity of theidentifying assumptions. The arguments for the validity of the RD design in this application do notrest on the presence of any conditioning variable. Therefore, conditioning on any predeterminedcovariates should not signicid:133cantly change the results. Of course, this procedure will detect lackof local randomization only if the local selfselection is related to the observed characteristics.Theorem 10 allows us to include additional control variables without changing the estimandbecause we integrate them out to obtain the unconditional eects. The large number of controlvariables X included prevents to use a completely nonparametric approach. We estimate thepropensity score p X by a parametric linear logistic regression and then implement ourestimator in the same way as we did without covariates. The QTEs estimated this way areplotted in Figure 3, which show that they are very close to those estimated without covariates.As in the original article, we cid:133nd no reason to reject the validity of the design.We have concentrated on one outcome variable math test one year after the summer schoolso far. In Figure 5 we show the QTE estimates for several other outcomes variables: math andreading test scores one and two years after the summer school, respectively.22 In the cid:133gure, we havesmoothed the results because the reading test score is less smooth and the estimated distributionfunctions were quite jumpy. The general pattern is the same for all outcomes, obtaining larger QTEs for larger quantiles.Table 1 pins down the results presented visually in the Figures 1 to 5 by giving the treatmenteects on six summary statistics of the outcome distributions. Standard errors were estimatedusing the sample analogs of the asymptotic variances derived in Theorem 9. The mean and themedian eects show that the summer school attendance had a a positive eect on the location ofthe outcome distribution. These eects are signicid:133cantly dierent from zero at levels ranging from 7.5% to 0.01%, depending on the outcome and on the statistic. The standard deviation, interdecile Y jc and Gini coe cient measure thetreatment eect on the dispersion of the outcomes. With one exception reading score two years Y jc, interquartile dierence Q0:75Y jc cid:0 Q0:25dierence Q0:9Y jc cid:0 Q0:1after the summer school the point estimates indicate that the treatment increased the dispersionof the scores. Some of these eects, most notably the interdecile ranges, are signicid:133cant and concid:133rm 22 The concid:133dence intervals for these estimates are similar to those shown in Figure 3.20the visual impression discussed above.236 Conclusion In this paper, we described how the regression discontinuity design can be used to evaluate theimpact of endogenous treatments on the entire distribution of outcome variables. We showed thatboth potential outcome distributions are identicid:133ed for the population aected by the discontinuity. We introduced estimators for these two distribution functions and showed their joint convergence to continuous Gaussian processes. We also obtained uniformly consistent estimates forfunctionals of the distribution functions and we considered in detail the quantile treatment eectprocess when the dependent variable is continuous. By appropriate bandwidth choice, our estimators are consistent at the ncid:025 rate, which is the optimal convergence rate for onedimensionalnonparametric estimation.The approach was illustrated through estimation of the quantile treatment eects of summerschool attendance on later educational performance. We used the same data and identicid:133cationstrategy as in Jacob and Lefgren 2004. Our results showed the heterogeneity of the treatmenteects, with no eect at the bottom of the distribution and signicid:133cantly positive eects at the topof the distribution.We believe that the estimators suggested in this paper have many interesting applications ineconomics, statistics and other social sciences. Since the late 1990s, a growing number of studieshave exploited threshold rules to estimate program eects. Additional insights could be gainedin all applications where the outcome is not binary by estimating the distributional eects of thetreatment. We make the estimators available in Stata to make them conveniently accessible andusable.23 The Gini coe cient makes sense only for variables with a positive support. Therefore, we transformed thedependent variables to satisfy this condition. This is debatable since this measure is not invariant to locationchanges. These results do not contradict the results using other measures of inequality.21A Proofs A.1 Proof of Theorem 1: Distribution functions of potential outcomes We have to show that FY 1jcu lim!0FY 0jcu lim!0E 1 Y cid:20 u I cid:0 pj Z 2 N; D 1E 1 Y cid:20 u I cid:0 pj Z 2 N; D 0E I cid:0 pj Z 2 N; D 1E I cid:0 pj Z 2 N; D 0,where p Pr Z cid:21 z 0j Z 2 N E I j Z 2 N.second equation are analogous.In the following, we will prove the cid:133rst equation and mention that the derivations for thelim!0 lim!0E 1 Y cid:20 u I cid:0 pj Z 2 N; D 1E I cid:0 pj Z 2 N; D 1E 1 Y cid:20 u I cid:0 p Dj Z 2 NE I cid:0 p Dj Z 2 N lim!0E 1 Y cid:20 u I cid:0 p Dj Z 2 N Ecid:2I cid:0 p Dj Z 2 N p E 1 Y cid:20 u I cid:0 p Dj Z 2 N cid:0 1 cid:0 p cid:3 p Ecid:2I cid:0 p Dj Z 2 N cid:0 cid:3 1 cid:0 p.4As next step, we examine the cid:133rst term of the numerator of 4.

The relationship 6 is shown via mean square convergence for each element of A.

N B;Vwhere B and V are decid:133ned below in the proof.Proof. By Lemma 11 and 12 we have a linear representation of the local linear estimator 5 ofa generic random variable W that is bounded between zero and one. Now we consider the jointnormality of FY 1jcu, FY 0jcu, FY 1jcu and FY 0jcu, i.e. of the estimators of the cdf at twodierent values u and u. For convenience we restate the decid:133nition of the estimator here:FY 1jcu m1Y cid:20uD cid:0 mcid:01Y cid:20uD.mD cid:0 mcid:0DNote that this estimator is a continuous function of estimators mW and mcid:0W for dierent genericvariables W , once for W 1 Y cid:20 u D and once for W D. In any case W is bounded betweenzero and one and all higher order moments exist.Decid:133ne the vector cid:18 as a function of the sample size and of u and u as cid:18 D; mcid:0D; m1Y cid:20uDcid:01; mcid:01Y cid:20uDcid:01; m1Y cid:20uD; mcid:01Y cid:20uD; m m1Y cid:20uD; mcid:01Y cid:20uD; m1Y cid:20uDcid:01; mcid:01Y cid:20uDcid:010.By the CramerWold device it is trivial to show that cid:18 converges to a jointly normal distribution: If cid:210cid:18 converges to a normal random variable for every conformable constant nonzero vectorcid:21, then cid:18 converges to a multivariate normal random variable. Because every element in cid:18 can berepresented in linear form as in 5, cid:210cid:18 is a sample average of random variables, for whom higherorder moments exist. Applying a CLT to cid:210cid:18, premultiplied with pnh, thus gives asymptotic normality, which thus implies joint normality of the elements in cid:18.With this notation, we can restate the estimators of the cdf asFY 1jcu FY 1jcu cid:183 cid:0 cid:184cid:181 cid:0 cid:182cid:187 cid:0 cid:188cid:181 cid:0 cid:182andandFY 0jcu FY 0jcu cid:185 cid:0 cid:186cid:181 cid:0 cid:182cid:189 cid:0 cid:1810cid:181 cid:0 cid:182where cid:18k refers to the kth element of cid:18. Consider FY 1jcu; FY 0jcu; FY 1jcu and FY 0jcu as avector of a continuous function of the asymptotically normal cid:18.
