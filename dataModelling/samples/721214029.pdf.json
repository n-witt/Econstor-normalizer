IZA Discussion Paper No. 6754 July 2012 ABSTRACT Constitutions and Economic Development: Evidence from the American Indian Nations This paper presents an empirical examination of economic and institutional development. Utilizing a novel data set on American Indian tribal nations, we investigate how constitutional design affects economic development, while holding the broader legal and political environment fixed. Instrumental variables regressions, using the party of the US President at the time of the initial adoption of tribal constitutions as an instrument for constitutional design, indicate that parliamentary systems versus presidential have a strong positive effect on economic development, while ordinary least squares regressions of current economic outcomes on parliamentary systems of government show no effects. Robustness checks suggest that the results are not explained by differences in other institutions or geographic characteristics. Additional results provide some suggestive evidence that the effects may operate through channels that are typically associated with parliamentary systems, such as larger public employment, and more equitable income distribution.

A particularly intense debate concerns the causaleffect of constitutional design on economic performance. Are the features of constitutions, such as the formof state, a relevant determinant of economic development? And how severe is reverse causality from economicdevelopment to the design of constitutions?This paper contributes to this literature by providing novel evidence for the effects of particular aspects ofconstitutional design, namely the form of state in terms of the accountability of the executive to the electorate,on economic performance. By isolating the causal effects of constitutions on economic performance, we alsoprovide indirect evidence for the reverse channel of causality in terms of endogenous adoption of particularconstitutions. The analysis is based on a newly assembled data set of American Indian tribal constitutionsfor 70 American Indian tribes with democratic governments and written constitutions. We have coded theinformation contained in these documents such as whether the executive is directly elected or indirectly electedas well as the year of the adoption of the first modern constitution and the years in which amendments occurred.All of these documents span the entirety of the 20th century. We merge this data with information on economicdevelopment indicators for the American Indian tribes in 1900, 1990, and 20052009 from the US Census andinvestigate the effect of political institutions on economic performance.The structure of the data resembles the typical structure of the empirical work on the longrun effects ofinstitutions, but has important additional features. First, since American Indian Nations are subject to thesame broader institutional framework of the United States, the data provide the unique possibility of holdingthe broader legal and political environment fixed. This alleviates many of the issues that affect the crosscountrypanel data common in this literature. Second, while the broader legal and political environments are heldconstant within the US federal framework, these American Indian Nations exhibit substantial heterogeneityin constitutional features. Third, the data contain an element of exogenous variation that can be exploitedfor identification purposes since, for some tribes, the choice of the constitutional details was heavily influencedby the US Federal government. These constitutional details were determined without regard to the economicconditions in the particular tribes at the time of constitutional adoption. We propose the use of the partyof the US President at the time of adoption of the American Indian constitution as a plausible instrumentalvariable. This instrument is unrelated to future economic outcomes but is directly related to the types ofpolitical institutions initially adopted; the executive branch of the US Federal government historically hada large amount of influence over American Indian constitutions. In later sections of this paper, we describeat length the rationale for this instrument and discuss why the instrument plausibly satisfies the exclusionrestriction. We are thus able to replicate the typical identification strategy in the literature, and estimatethe effects of constitutional design and political institutions on economic performance of American Indian 2Nations in modern times.Our results suggest that there is indeed a bidirectional causal relationship between constitutional detailsand economic performance when comparing the results from OLS regressions and from IV estimates that exploitexogenous variation in constitutional details. In OLS regressions, we find no effects of political institutionson economic development between 1990 and 20052009. These results are likely to be subject to endogeneitybias, however. Results from instrumental variables estimations indicate that political institutions do affecteconomic growth. In particular, tribes with indirectly elected chief executives i.e., a parliamentary form ofgovernment have significantly faster growth in per capita incomes, labor force participation rates, and collegeeducation, as well as significantly lower unemployment growth over the 1990 to 20052009 period.Additional results demonstrate the robustness of our findings and provide evidence for the channels throughwhich the effects work. The results are robust to additional controls for economic development such as theyear of the adoption of the initial constitution, the distance to the nearest city, and regional controls. Wealso find that the existence of other political institutions, such as having an independent judiciary, staggeredelections, or the size of the tribal council do not affect our results. Finally, accounting for the presence ofcasino operations on the tribal reservations does not reduce the size of the coefficient on an indirectly electedchief executive. Placebo estimates suggest that the results are not driven by a nonrandom selection of tribesas tribes do not differ in observable characteristics prior to the adoption of the first constitution.The form of state is a central constitutional feature that affects economic development through severalchannels. Parliamentary systems are likely to exhibit larger government expenditures, more employment inthe public sector, as well as higher degrees of redistribution, but also a larger potential for nepotism, inefficientuse of public resources, and corruption see, e.g., Persson, Roland and Tabellini, 1997, or Alt and Lassen,2007. As potential channels for the effect of constitutional design, we investigate the role of governmentalemployment and redistribution. In line with the predictions from the political economy literature, we findevidence that tribes with a parliamentary form of government exhibit larger states in terms of employmentin the public sector. We also find evidence for a reduction in poverty in addition to the effect on meanincomes, consistent with the prediction of more redistribution and equality in parliamentary systems. Theseresults suggest that the observed economic improvements are driven by increased government employment andbusiness opportunities for tribal governments with initial parliamentary institutions.Our paper contributes to the literature on the effects of political institutions for public policies and economic development. Persson and Tabellini 2003, 2004 estimated the effect of different forms of state andelectoral rules on central government expenditures, redistribution, and debt using crosscountry panel dataand find lower levels of central government expenditures and redistribution in presidential systems. Whilethese findings have been criticized with regards to the potential endogeneity of constitutions to economic performance Acemoglu 2005, Persson and Tabellini 2006 found evidence for the form of government affectingthe economic performance of newly democratized countries using panel regressions. More recently, Coate and 3Knight 2011 investigate the effect of government form on public spending at the community level and findevidence that public spending is lower in governments with directly elected executive mayorcouncil form ofgovernment than under indirectly elected councilmanager governments. Their theoretical results also suggest, however, that depending on the preferences distribution either system can be preferable to the electorate.Rather than looking at fiscal policy outcomes as these works, our study focuses on development outcomes.More importantly, our data allows us to rule out potential endogeneity and estimate the causal effect of constitutional design on development by applying an identification strategy based on the random assignment ofconstitutional design through the influence of the US Federal government.Our investigation complements earlier studies on the effects of institutions on development, includingstudies by Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson 2001, Iyer 2011, or Acemoglu et al. 2012. In contrast tothese studies, we observe the institutions at their initial adoption as well as contemporaneously. This studyalso contributes to another important strand of the literature that focuses on the determinants of politicalinstitutions, and the persistence of institutions over time, pioneered by Acemoglu and Robinson 2000, 2001,2006. This literature suggests that political institutions are shaped by selfinterests of different groups ofsociety as well as by constraints on the possibility of political rulers to commit to certain policies. Institutionsemerge endogenously and do not necessarily reflect the institutional design that would lead to efficient economicoutcomes, but rather reflect distributional conflicts and inequality in de facto political power. The case of American Indian Nations provides a suitable laboratory to study the effects of institutions on developmentbecause of the availability of exogenous influences that shape the initial constitutional design and that can beexploited to shed new light on the causal role of institutions for development, as well as on potential endogeneityin constitutional design. Our paper also adds to the growing literature on the effect of political institutionson economic development and the provision of public goods in developing countries. There is evidence thatincreases in electoral accountability significantly reduces politician corruption. In Brazil, Ferraz and Finan2008, 2009 find that electoral rules which increase accountability the possibility of reelection results inreduced corrupt behavior. They also find that voters respond to evidence published audit reports of mayoralbudgets about politician behavior and punish more corrupt incumbents at election time. Finally, our paperalso adds to a small, but important, literature on the effect of contemporaneous constitutional characteristicson economic development for American Indians. We contribute to the literature pioneered by Cornell and Kalt1995a, 1995b, 2000 by adding information of the initial types of constitutions adopted and their implicationsfor subsequent development.The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. The next section provides some background informationon American Indian Tribal nations and discusses the data and sample construction. Section 3 presents theempirical strategy, and Section 4 presents the main empirical results, the results from robustness checks, andadditional results regarding the channel through which the effect operates. Section 5 concludes.42 Data on Constitutions of American Indian Nations 2.1 Historical Background American Indian Nations are a third form of government recognized in the US Constitution along with the USFederal and State governments Duthu, 2008. Indeed, the US Constitution treated many of the American Indian Nations as foreign nations at least at the time of the establishment of the United States. Over the past twocenturies, the US Supreme Court has ruled that American Indian nations are a separate form of governmentfrom that of US states, but they have been put under the US federal governments authority and are now classified as domestic dependent nations Wilkins, 2002. Today there are over 560 federally recognized American Indian tribal nations including Alaska Natives. These nations have a direct governmenttogovernment relationship with the United States. There are numerous nonfederally recognized tribal governments, but we donot consider these tribal governments in our current analysis.By 1871, the US unilaterally ceased making treaties with American Indian nations Duthu, 2008. Thismarks a turning point in the US relationship with American Indian tribes; the tribes were treated as domesticentities and not the foreign, independent entities of the past. These changes were driven in part by thesettlement of much of the continental United States as well as the increased military power of the US. In 1887,the General Allotment Act was created to privatize and develop American Indian lands. The purpose was totransform the American Indians into farmers and small business owners with access to private property andcapital. Previously, the American Indian land had been held communally by the entire tribe and was inalienableas well as taxexempt given the sovereign status of American Indian tribes. The land privatization was acomplete failure and reduced the amount of land under American Indian control in 1887 from approximately 138 million acres to about 48 million acres in the early 20th century through coerced land sales, foreclosuresand delinquent tax payments Newton et al, 2005. No corresponding improvement in economic or socialconditions for the American Indian land owners was visible; in fact, Hacker and Haines 2005 have shownthat child mortality increased significantly for households that received allotted lands. Additionally, the USSupreme Court ruled in the 1903 court case Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock that the US Congress has plenary powerover American Indian lands Duthu, 2008. While the US Constitution discusses American Indian tribes in twoplaces, neither grants Congress plenary power over the tribes Deloria and Wilkins, 1999. This new Supreme Court interpretation allowed Congress to unilaterally suspend any and all treaty promises without review orredress by American Indian tribes.American Indians are US citizens and may also be tribal citizens of federally or nonfederally recognizedtribes Wilkins, 2006. Federal income tax laws apply to individuals residing on the reservation, but the tribalgovernment itself may be exempt from state and other local jurisdictional laws and taxation Wilkins, 2002;p. 14. The American Indian nation itself has sovereign immunity and has the ability to establish its owntaxation and laws that are not expressly forbidden by the US Congress. This relationship between the US5government and American Indian tribal nations is based on historical treaties and political relationships duringthe age of expansion and westward settlement in the US. Preceding the establishment of the US constitution,several American Indian nations had clearly established constitutions and rules of governance, for examplethe socalled Five Civilized Tribes Deloria Lytle, 1983. In this work, we examine the promulgation andadoption of modern constitutions in American Indian nations after the age of US westward expansion and theestablishment of reservation based American Indian Nations at the beginning of the 20th century.Overall the history of American Indians in the United States has been one of poverty and substantialunderdevelopment. Lands under American Indian control in the continental United States amounts to approximately fifty six million acres or about 4 percent of all US lands Wilkins, 2002. Recently there has beensome improvement in economic conditions; real per capita income has increased by 33% between 1990 and 2000 for American Indians residing on reservations. Additionally, family poverty rates have fallen about 10percentage points between 1990 and 2000 48% to 37% for tribes without casino operations and 36% to 27%for tribes with casino operations, see Kalt and Taylor 2005. Our research aims to investigate the politicaldeterminants of these improvements in economic outcomes.2.2 American Indian Constitutions The history of American Indian constitutional change provides a very interesting case for studying the impactof political institutions on economic development. The composition and nature of the initial constitutionsadopted by most American Indian tribes was not necessarily of their own doing. The Bureau of Indian Affairsplayed a very important role in the design of many of these tribal constitutions. Templates of the importantclauses and sections of constitutions were distributed to tribes via the Bureau of Indian Affairs Wilkins, 2006;Cohen, 2006. The starting point of most American Indian tribal constitutions was not from preexistinggovernance systems, but a USinspired version. These imposed, and to the American Indian nations somewhatforeign, political institutions did not necessarily reflect traditional or moral tribal values and led to highlevels of political turmoil and corruption in tribal government activities Cornell and Kalt, 2000. Due to theperceived illegitimacy of some of these government types, tribal governments have faced a range of problemssuch as political instability, government closure and attacks on government officials Lemont, 2006; p 3. Whilea few American Indian tribes had constitutions in the 1800s, many of these tribes were forcefully relocatedby the US Federal government and resulted in a disruption of these preexisting governments Wilkins, 2002.Consequently, new constitutions were adopted in the early 20th century to reflect the new geographic, politicaland economic conditions for these American Indian tribal nations. Several changes occurred at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries with regard to the US Federal governments relationship and dealingswith American Indian tribes. After the conclusion of the US Civil War, the US Federal government moved the Bureau of Indian Affairs from the War Department to the new Department of the Interior signaling a changein the threat level associated with American Indian tribes Wilkins, 2002.62.3 Data Sources For this study, we collected American Indian constitutions and their amendments for over 70 American Indiannations. The empirical analysis is based on American Indian governments that have democratic forms ofgovernment, a written constitution, and a population of more than 750 citizens. One criterion for selectingthese American Indian nations was that they had to have a sufficiently large population for political engagement. There are over 560 federally recognized American Indian and Alaska Native nations in the US. A largeproportion of the federally recognized tribes have tribal populations that number only a few hundred people.Therefore, we restricted our analysis to the large tribes with at least 750 members. The smaller tribal nationswere omitted for several reasons. The first is that generally the smaller tribes have less resources and operateon a more informal basis; family and clan relationships tend to dominate in these particular tribes. Second,many of these smaller tribes do not have a formal, written constitution. In fact, in the current analysis weomit all tribes with unwritten legal and political codes. This necessarily eliminates tribes such as the Navajo Nation which operate on an unwritten, traditional code of governance. We have also omitted the theocraciesand corporate governance structures.1We compiled the constitutional documents from publicly available sources and locations. The National Indian Law Library, which is part of the Native American Rights Fund, has an extensive collection of constitutions online. Additionally, the University of Oklahoma law library also provides a large collection of American Indian constitutions. We found amendments to the constitutions by direct contact with the tribes,their websites and various interlibrary loans from individual law libraries across the country. Finally, weexamined constitutions at the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Washington, DC where a number but not all ofthe constitutions are archived.In total, the data are based on approximately 450 different files or documentation regarding the constitutionor the amendments. We coded the initial political institutions contained in the constitutions and recordedthe changes made to these constitutions as well as the year in which they were made. For the purpose ofthe present study we focus on a central element of the tribal nations political institution whether the chiefexecutive is elected indirectly or directly. The data also contain information about other political institutionssuch as staggered terms and an independent judiciary.We merge the constitutions and amendment data with census data from the 1900 US Census at the tribalgovernment level. This data is available from the Minnesota Population Center IPUMS website and representsa 20% sample of American Indians by the US Census Bureau. The data contains characteristics of thereservations prior to the adoption of their modern constitutions. The variables, while somewhat limited and 1The theocratic tribal governments, primarily the Pueblo tribes of the US Southwest, were treated differently due to theirlongstanding government to government relationships with Spain and Mexico, see Spicer 1962. On the other hand, Alaska Native Villages are often quite small and operate under a corporate governance structure as described in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971.7not perfectly comparable to recent data from the US Census, are nevertheless useful as control variables for theregressions that follow. As outcome variables, we use data from more recent waves of the US Census 1990 and 20052009 American Community Survey.2 In particular, we have selected four variables that reflect economicdevelopment on American Indian reservations: per capita income, percent in the labor force, unemploymentrate and percent of the population with a posthigh school education tertiary or more. The variables areindicative of economic conditions on American Indian reservations.2.4 Descriptive Statistics In Table 1 we present the means and characteristics of our sample data. Panel A of Table 1 provides informationon the main outcome variables of interest in our analysis for the year 1990. Average per capita incomein 1990is approximately 5,160 in 1990 dollars which is significantly lower than the US average of 19,374 Kalt and Taylor, 2005. American Indian reservations on average are much less developed than the rest of the United States. For instance, the percentage of adults in the labor force on reservations in 1990 is 57% and has aminimum amount of just 36%. The unemployment rate is a useful measure of the economic conditions on thereservation. Individual American Indians, of course, have the option to work off of the reservation; we viewthis as a proxy for economic activity on and around the American Indian reservation. In 1990 the average rateof unemployment was approximately 23% with ranges as low as 4% and as high as 44%.On average, 24% of adults aged 25 and older on the American Indian reservations have a postsecondaryeducation. We include this measure of human capital in order to identify an additional dimension of economicdevelopment on the reservations. There is quite a large range of values across the different tribes with respectto this variable; there is a range of 1040% across the reservations in our sample. To account for differencesin population size and land area, we also constructed a population density variable from information aboutthe number of people living on Indian lands in 1990 and the square miles of Indian lands in 1990. This loggedvariable ranges in value from 2.12 to 5.45 with an average log population per square mile of 1.49.In panel B, the data from the American Community Survey 20052009 for American Indian reservations isprovided. We have deflated the per capita income to 1990 prices and find that there has been a pronouncedincrease in real per capita income to 8,400. In general, there has been an improvement in all of the fourvariables as compared to the 1990 levels. Labor force participation has increased, unemployment has decreasedand the percent of adults with a postsecondary education has increased on average to 43%.Panel C of Table 1 provides the variables from the 1900 US Census for the American Indian reservations.While the data for this time period is limited, there are several useful variables that provide some indication of 2Unfortunately, the US Census Bureau did not collect separate data for American Indian reservations for most of the 20thcentury; the census geography captures modern reservations starting in the 1990 census. Therefore, we are unable to examineeconomic outcomes earlier than 1990. Also, the characteristics of the population are now collected annually in the American Community Survey ACS and are presented only as 5 year averages for communities with less than 20,000 individuals. Therefore,we use the 20052009 ACS data for our current economic outcomes on American Indian reservations.8the levels of economic development on each reservation prior to the adoption of the initial modern constitutions.In 1900 the average age is approximately 26 years; the population is highly skewed towards the young which ischaracteristic of developing countries. The malefemale ratio is roughly equal on average across the differentreservations in 1900. Approximately 40% of the adults on the reservations were married in 1900. The percentof adults in the labor force in 1900 is approximately 20% on average. The labor force variable does not includeselfemployed farmers, which may explain this relatively low labor force participation rate. Approximately 17% of the population of an average reservation is literate in 1900. The literacy variable is a useful proxyfor education and general skill levels of the population. Again there is tremendous heterogeneity across tribeswith some tribes reporting no literate individuals and other tribes with literacy rates of almost 50%.While we do not have a direct measure of individual incomes in the 1900 census,3 we do have a measure ofoccupations. Conveniently, there is an index of occupations which are ranked according to their wages containedin the data. This occupationincome index measure is an imperfect measure of income on the American Indianreservations in 1900 but it is the best available data. We took a simple average of all employed people onthe reservation and the mean value is 5.6, the minimum and maximum values are 0 to 13.7. We view thisoccupational index measure as an ordinal measure of average income on the reservations.The 1900 US Census contains an interesting variable which is not present in current census data thepercent of intermarriage between American Indians and nonIndians. While this is a somewhat unusualvariable it does provide a proxy measure for the degree of intermixing between the American Indian tribe andthe surrounding nonIndian community. Additionally, we view this variable as a measure of social integrationacross the two groups. While our research is primarily concerned with the effect of political institutions oneconomic development, this variable allows us to control for potential differences in ethnic heterogeneity acrossthe different American Indian tribes. The average percent of white blood in our sample of reservations is 9%.There is a lot of heterogeneity with certain tribes having no intermixing and a few outliers that have over 40%white blood in 1900.The next set of variables indicate the geographic location of the tribal reservation in five different censusregions in the lower US. There are no Eastern American Indian tribes included in this data. As mentionedpreviously, we have restricted our analysis to the larger, federally recognized American Indian tribes withwritten constitutions and this necessarily excludes the Eastern tribes.Panel D of Table 1 provides information about the tribal constitutions and their amendments. The averagetribe adopted the first constitution in 1943.4 Around 76% of tribes adopted their first constitution under a Democratic US Federal administration. At the time of the initial adoption of the constitution, approximately 57% of the tribes had an indirectly elected chief executive, where the tribal council decides from among its 3The US Census Bureau began asking individual income information only starting with the 1940 US Census.4Only one tribe adopted the initial constitution after 1990, namely in 1994. Dropping this tribe from the sample does not affectthe empirical results.9own members who will be the chief executive. By 1990 that percentage had decreased to 30%.53 Empirical Framework This section discusses the identification problem as well as different empirical strategies to identify the effectof political institutions on economic performance.3.1 The Estimation Problem The goal of this paper is to investigate the potential effect of constitutional design on economic development.The typical framework used in the literature to estimate this effect is given by Yi I0i Xi 0i :,1where Yi denotes the growth in one of four separate measures of outcomes on reservation i over the timeperiod 1990 to 20052009. These outcome variables include per capita income, unemployment level, percentof adults with high school education or more, and percent in the labor force. The vector X includes controlsfor characteristics of the reservation in 1900, that is, prior to the adoption of the first modern constitutions.In particular, the vector contains the following characteristics of the reservation: average age, share women,marital status, labor force participation rates, measure of intermarriage, occupationalincome index measure,and literacy rates. Additionally, X includes controls for reservation characteristics in 1990 such as log percapita income. This accounts for observable differences in economic development as well as for convergence.6Institutions I are measured as binary indicators of whether or not the initial constitution of tribe i calls for thechief executive to be indirectly elected I0i 1, where t 0 represents the time when the initial constitutionis adopted. The indicator is zero I0i 0 when the chief executive is directly elected. In light of the politicaleconomy literature, an indirectly elected executive represents a parliamentary system, while a directly electedexecutive represents a presidential system. Differences in the way the executive is elected reflect differencesin the accountability of the executive, and therefore an institutional environment that differs in terms of itsconduciveness for economic development see, also the findings from the crosscountry literature, e.g., Perssonand Tabellini, 2003, 2004. The coefficient of interest is .5An example for a tribe that changed the constitutional details of the election of the executive is the Apache tribe of the Mescalero Reservation in New Mexico. In their first constitution, which was approved on March 25, 1936, the Apaches on the Mescalero Reservation had a business committee elected. The president as well as other functions were then elected by the businesscommittee. These procedures were subsequently reformed, and the new constitution approved on January 12, 1965, stipulatedthat the tribal president be elected in general elections. Also the organization of government changed along with this reform.6Various combinations of different 1990 control variables do not significantly affect the observed results. Therefore, we use thelog per capita income measure as the primary 1990 control variable in our preferred specifcation. See also the robustness resultsin Section 4.310In principle, the data also contain information for the constitutions at later points in time. Assuming that is a deep and stable parameter, an alternative estimation could therefore exploit this information at timet 1, e.g. in 1990 before our outcomes are measured, and estimate Yi I1i Xi 1i : .2Without additional assumptions, it is not obvious that is actually identified in these estimation frameworks, because reverse causality problems might bias the estimates. For instance, the adoption of a particularconstitutional design might be endogenous to the economic development prospects of a particular tribe suchthat I0 is correlated with 0, or constitutions may change endogenously over time such that I1 might becorrelated with 1.3.2 Identification using Initial Assignment of Institutions To account for the potential endogeneity problem, we employ an instrumental variables approach that exploitshistorical conditions in order to identify the effect of constitutional design on economic growth. This is possibledue to the peculiarities of the political liberalization process that American Indian tribes underwent in thelate 19th and early 20th Century.US Presidential Party and the Adoption of American Indian Constitutions. As the 19th centurydrew to a close the political and legal landscape changed dramatically for American Indian tribes. Previousmodels of informal governance were not effective in dealing with the reduction in land holdings and rights.The US Federal government reduced the standing of tribal nations to domesticdependent nations and therebegan an erosion of rights and protections such as the loss of autonomy and treaty rights. In order to dealmore effectively with the US Federal government and the US states, American Indian tribes began to establishcentralized governments. Tribes adopted their preferred constitution based on very local and specific conditionsand experiences.In order to establish and adopt formal constitutions, many American Indian tribes sought help and assistance from the Bureau of Indian Affairs BIA. The BIA operates under the Secretary of the Interior and isappointed by the US President. Congress authorizes the budget of the Bureau of Indian Affairs as noted in the US Constitution and supported by numerous US Supreme Court rulings Duthu, 2008; Deloria and Wilkins,1999. Specifically, the Bureau of Indian Affairs responded to requests for assistance in drafting constitutions.Elmer 2006 provides an example for the 1930s where the BIA was tasked with responding to requests fordrafting constitutions; the Bureau was not empowered to seek out tribes itself. While there may have been noexplicit directive, there appears to have been at least indirect influence in terms of political institutions.Once a constitution was proposed or considered, the Bureau of Indian Affairs exerted influence and pressureon the kinds of political institutions that could be adopted. The instrumental variable for parliamentary versus 11presidential systems is based on the fact that the nature and type of constitution adopted by American Indiannations has been heavily influenced the Bureau of Indian Affairs, which is subordinate to the Secretary of the Interior of the US Federal Government. The approval and influence of constitutiontype is therefore relatedto the political position of the respective US Presidential administration.First, under Democratic leadership in the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Felix Cohen, in the 1930s, drafted adocument for the writing of tribal constitutions with numerous suggestions. This memo provided extensiveinformation on the clauses and contents of a constitution. Additionally, the document provided a modelconstitution in the appendix. For the purposes of this paper it is useful in that the model only contained asingle type of institution for the election of chief executives an indirectly elected or parliamentarytype systemCohen, 2006; Wilkins, 2006; Deloria and Lytle, 1983. Beyond this influence, the Bureau of Indian Affairshad approval power over the nature of the American Indian tribal constitutions. The hypothesis motivatingour instrumentation strategy is that under Democratic US Presidents there was a systematic tendency tofavor the adoption of the parliamentary type chief executive, while under Republican US Presidents therewas a tendency to favor the adoption of the direct election of the chief executive, i.e., a presidential form ofgovernment. One reason for the difference is that there might be a difference of opinions according to politicalparty on the idea of assimilation and appropriate political institutions. Theodore Roosevelt, a generationearlier and a Republican US President, saw the new American Indian programs such as allotment as a usefultool to dismember American Indian tribes and to transform them into American ideals. The imposition ofa presidential system of government was one method of assimilating the American Indian tribes into the USmodel of governing. On the other hand, the Democrats and their administration paid more attention to thepreexisting social and political structures. Existing political institutions for American Indians resembled amore communal approach to decisionmaking and power sharing which is closer to a parliamentary type ofgovernment Champagne, 2006.An Instrumental Variables Approach.In the following, we exploit these peculiarities by using the partyof the US President at the time of the American Indian tribes adoption of their initial constitution as aninstrument for the constitutional design. Consequently, our first stage regression when considering initialinstitutions in terms of I0 as in 1 is given bywhile the corresponding first stage for an outcome equation with current institutions I1, as in 2, is I0i Zi Xi u 0i :,I1i Zi Xi u 1i : .34We use an indicator variable for our instrument, Z, that takes the value of 1 if the party of the US12President at the time of the initial adoption of the American Indian constitution was Democrat and 0 if itwas Republican. The outcome variable, I, is a binary indicator that takes value 1 if the respective politicalinstitution is characterized by indirectly elected executives, and 0 if not. The first stage regression is givenby a linear probability model. Provided that for political and ideological reasons Democratic Presidentialadministrations were more favorable to indirect democratic structures than Republican administrations as wasdiscussed above, the instrument is expected to be positively related to whether the political party of the USPresident at the time of adoption was a Democrat.7Constitutional amendments occurred later during 20th century in some tribes when considerable power andauthority was restored to American Indian tribes to make decisions about their own political structures. Theperiod, since the mid1960s onwards is known as the era of Indian SelfDetermination. Therefore, we shouldview these constitutional amendments as being primarily driven by tribal preferences and less influenced byofficials from the Bureau of Indian Affairs in this later period. It is an openquestion as to what exactly determines these constitutional amendments. There is a clear case to be made for the endogeneity of constitutionalchanges and economic performance, but uncovering the determinants of these changes ins beyond the scope ofthis paper.The maintained assumptions for identification of the effect are that the instrumental variable, Z, is notrelated to the error term in the respective outcome equation 1 or 2 above. There is no evidence that American Indian tribes were making their decisions about whether to adopt a formal constitution based onthe political party of the US President or the executive branch appointees. Instead, the historical evidencesuggests that the primary motivation for adopting a formal constitution was based on individual reservationbased conditions and was divorced from conditions in Washington, D.C. Additionally, there is no evidencethat tribes attempted to game the system and wait for a different US President and a change in politicalappointees in the executive branch; empirically, there are no large numbers of constitutional adoptions afteran election when the party of the US President changes. It is also useful to note that the party of the USPresident at the time of adoption of the constitution should have no differential if at all effect on the fundingof American Indian tribal nations in the future; funding for American Indian tribal nations is appropriated bythe US Congress and has no relationship to prior US Presidential administrations. In fact, funding for largeprograms such as education and health care provision are often tied to simple formulas based on populationsize see, for instance, United States General Accounting Office, p. 6, 2003.In Table 2 we compare the tribal characteristics from the 1900 US Census for the tribes that adopted a constitution under a Republican or Democratic US Presidential administration. The numbers suggest that there islittle or no difference in American Indian tribes which adopted constitutions under Democratic or Republican 7We find no evidence for tribes predominantly adopting new constitutions immediately after or immediately before a change inthe US President from one party to the other, or presidential elections. For instance, only 2 tribes adopt a constitution within 2years of the change in political party; dropping these observations do not change our results.13US Presidents. Based on 1900 observable characteristics we do not find that on average there is a statisticallysignificant difference across the two tribal groups. When comparing the means of the 1900 characteristicsbetween the two types of tribes, we find that none of the characteristics are statistically significant. The onlyvariable with a statistically significant difference at the 10% level is total white blood, suggesting that tribesthat have adopted a constitution under a Republican presidential administration tend to have slightly higherlevels of white blood in 1900. This difference, while marginally statistically significant, is about 5 percentagepoints on average and hence not large in absolute terms, such that, for both types of reservations, the population is still fairly homogenous with a high degree of American Indian blood in 1900. Overall, the descriptivesshow that tribes were very similar in terms of demographic composition and labor force participation. Mostimportantly, the two types of tribes do not differ along the other economically meaningful variables such asthe occupationalincome index score, literacy rates and labor force participation rates.4 Empirical Results This section presents the main results of our empirical investigation of the role of different election rules forthe chief executive on changes in economic development variables between 1990 and 20052009. We focus onfour outcome variables that are available in the US Census data: per capita income, percent in labor force,unemployment rate and percent with posthigh school education. We selected these variables as they are usefulindicators of economic development in different dimensions on the reservations at the time. Throughout, weestimate linear models and use the characteristics of the tribe in 1900 as explanatory variables reflecting theterm X. We present results for the different estimation frameworks discussed above: OLS, as well as 2SLSestimates using the party of the US President at the time of their constitutional adoption as the instrumentfor institutions at constitutional adoption, I0, or after subsequent amendments by 1990, I1.4.1 Constitutional Design and Economic Performance: OLS Results Table 3 presents the results of OLS regressions of economic development in terms of changes in the economicdevelopment variables between 1990 and 20052009 as dependent variable on constitutional design variablesand controls. Columns 14 present results for specification 1 with constitutional design when constitutions where adopted, while Columns 58 present results for the specification 2 with political institutionsmeasured in 1990. The estimated coefficients for constitutional design in terms of indirectly elected executiveare small in magnitude and statistically insignificant for all cases. The results suggest that neither initialnor current political institutions have a significant effect on the change in economic development variables.These findings are likely to be biased because of endogeneity problems, however. The bias might arise due toendogeneity in the sense that systematic but unobserved crosstribal differences determine institutional designas well as economic performance.In addition, the estimates of specification 2 might also be affected by 14endogenous changes in the institutions after the initial adoption of a constitution in response to economicperformance ex interim. For instance, the coefficient on directly elected chief executive is likely to be differentin specifications 1 and 2 as tribes amend their constitutions in response to political conflicts among thetribe members, or in order to attain better economic performance. This might contribute additional variancethat biases the estimates and renders the returns associated with a particular type of political institutionstatistically insignificant. Taken together, the results from ordinary least squares regressions suggest thatpolitical institutions have little effect on changes in economic development between 1990 and 20052009.4.2 Constitutional Design and Economic Performance: 2SLS Results To account for the potential endogeneity bias that affects these estimates, we proceed by presenting results thatexploit exogenous variation in constitutional design using our instrumentation approach. The specification ofthe outcome equation is again as in 1 or 2, respectively, but the effect of institutions I is estimated usingthe the party of the US President at the time of adoption of the first constitution as instrument.Table 4 presents reduced form estimates of economic development over the period 199020059 regressedon the binary instrument of whether the US president was a Democrat at the time of the initial adoption ofthe respective tribal constitution. The results suggest that tribes that adopted their initial constitution undera Democrat federal administration exhibit significantly faster income growth, as well as a faster increase inlabor force participation, a slower increase in unemployment rates and an increase in the percent of adultson the reservation with postsecondary education, compared to tribes that adopted their initial constitutionsunder a Republican federal administration.Table 5 presents the results from 2SLS regressions. Column I.1 contains the first stage estimates of theinstrumented variable as in 3 constitutional design in terms of indirectly elected executive at the time of theinitial adoption of the constitution regressed on the instrument of whether the US President was Democratat the time of the initial tribal constitution adoption, plus controls. The instrument has a statistically highlysignificant effect on the constitutional design at initial adoption, indicating that, as expected, tribes thatadopted their initial constitution under a Democrat president were more likely to have executives electedindirectly. The FStatistic for this instrument is 14.79, indicating that the first stage relation is reasonablystrong. Columns 14 present estimates for outcome equations on the second stage. The results largelyconfirm the results of the reduced form estimates. Constitutional design has significant effects on economicperformance. Tribes with constitutions that stipulate indirectly elected executives have faster income growthover the period 199020059, exhibit faster growth of the labor force, a faster drop in unemployment, andan increase in people with postsecondary education on the reservation. All these results hold conditional onthe level of development in 1990, as proxied by income per capita. The log difference in income per capita isabout 0.36 larger for tribes with indirectly elected executives. This is approximately half of the difference inmean income provided in Table 1 between 1990 and 20052009, and corresponds to annual growth in income 15per capita being about 2.5 percent faster on average. The labor force grows by about half a percentage pointfaster each year; and unemployment shrinks by about half a percentage point faster per year. The percent ofadults older than 25 that have postsecondary education increases by about 4% over this time period.The second part of Table 5 presents the corresponding results when adopting specification 2 and estimating the effects of constitutional details by instrumenting institutions as of 1990, at the beginning of theperiod in which outcomes are measured, as in 4. In light of the fact that tribes might have changed theirconstitutions between the initial adoption and 1990, potentially in response to economic performance or forother political economy reasons, it is to be expected that the instrument is weaker in this specification thanfor constitutions at adoption.Column I.2 presents the respective first stage estimates, which confirm this conjecture. The coefficientestimate of the instrument on the first stage is smaller and statistically less significant. Although there is apositive and significant effect of having a Democrat administration for the US President on the probabilitythat a tribe has an indirectly elected chief executive in 1990, the FStatistic for this instrument is only 6.75. Columns 58 present results for the outcomes in terms of economic development variables between 1990 and 20052009 on the second stage. Throughout, the results confirm the previous results in Columns14. Having a constitution stipulating indirectly elected executives in 1990, instrumented by having a Democratic Federal administration at the initial adoption results, has a positive effect on income growthand labor force participation, implies a faster reduction in unemployment, and an increase in postsecondaryeducated individuals on the reservation. In terms of magnitude, all estimates obtained with specification 2imply larger effects on the second stage. This could be due to a problem of a weaker performance of theinstrument on the first stage. Alternatively, it is possible that current institutions have a stronger effect onoutcomes than initial institutions, which might have changed subsequently and hence do not reflect the actualinstitutional setting at the beginning of the observation period of outcomes. The emerging picture is thereforeconsistent with initial institutions, I0, rather than contemporaneous institutions, I1, being more stronglyaffected by the instrument having a stronger influence on political institution decisions at the moment ofadoption, but having a weaker effect on current outcomes as compared to current institutions.To conclude, for tribes that comply with the assignment of political institutions at the time of adoption asdetermined by the party of the US President, we find that those with an indirectly elected chief executive havebetter economic performance in terms of a larger growth in per capita income, a faster increase in labor forceparticipation, a faster reduction in unemployment and an increase in the percent of adults on the reservationwith postsecondary education.4.3 Robustness This section presents several robustness checks in order to investigate whether other potential mechanisms areresponsible for the observed outcomes. The respective tables are found in the Appendix.164.3.1 Years Since Constitutional Adoption and Distance to Nearest Large City The results so far were obtained under the premise that the federal administration at the adoption of theinitial tribal constitution is a valid instrument for constitutional design in terms of the form of governmentstipulated by the constitutional article on whether executives are elected directly or indirectly. The validity ofthis instruments hinges on two critical assumptions. First, the federal administration must not reflect otherunobserved heterogeneity in tribal characteristics that are related with outcomes. This could be the case,for example, if there is a time trend in the adoption of a constitution, such that tribes that adopt their firstconstitution early on are systematically different from tribes that adopt their constitutions later, i.e., if theyears since adoption of a constitution affect the efficacy and efficiency of tribal governments. If the timing ofthe adoption correlates with the party of the US President, this would render the exclusion restriction invalidand the identification flawed. A potential way to account for this confound is to control directly for the timeelapsed since the initial adoption of a constitution.Second, there might be other characteristics that are unrelated to the timing of the adoption, but thathave to do with geographic features that are not accounted for by the region controls.8 For instance, thedevelopment potential of a tribal community in terms of income, but in particular labor market performance,might be crucially affected by the possibility to commute off of the tribal reservation for work. To account forthis possibility, one would have to control for the distance to the nearest city.Table 6 presents 2SLS estimation results for the specification of the outcome equation as in 1 that includethe years since the constitution was initially adopted, as well as the distance to the nearest city in milesas additional controls.9 The results are qualitatively unaffected and quantitatively very similar compared tothe previous results. Years since initial adoption has a significant effect on the probability of observing anindirectly elected executive in the initial constitution, but the instrument remains strong and significant inpredicting constitutional design. In addition, there is no effect of years since initial adoption on any of theoutcomes on the second stage. Distance to the nearest city leaves the first stage unaffected.4.3.2 Additional Controls for Development as of 1990Table 7 presents the results of a similar analysis to the one above, except that the specification includesadditional control variables in terms of the levels of the respective outcome variable as of 1990. These specifications are equivalent to estimates with the level of the respective outcome variable in 20059 as the dependent 8An additional characteristic of this analysis is that all of the tribes examined here are federallyrecognized by the US Federalgovernment and hence are eligible for the exact same types and amounts of federal programs. There is no differential treatmentby the US Federal government and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. There are other staterecognized and nonrecognized indigenouspeoples in the US that are not included in this analysis for the specific reason that they would face very different economic andsocial opportunities.9In this and the following robustness checks, we restrict attention to specification 1 due to its better first stage performance.All results are qualitatively similar for estimates of specification 2.17variable, and therefore correspond to the usual specification used in empirical studies of the fundamental determinants of development see, e.g., Spolaore and Wacziarg, 2012. As in the previous Table, columns 14contain second stage results for specification 1 for the outcome equation, while columns 58 contain results for specification 2. The performance of the respective first stages not shown is similar to before, with Fstatistics in the range between 13 and 14 for the specifications in columns 14, and smaller values in therange between 5 and 8 for the various first stages for outcomes in columns 58. The results on the secondstage are quite similar for log percapita income and percent in the labor force to those found previously whenonly the log per capita in 1990 had been included as additional control variable. However, the coefficients in theunemployment and postsecondary education regressions are smaller in magnitude and statistical significancethan in the previous tables.Table 8 shows the results of estimates of specification 1 with an even more extensive set of controls fordevelopment in 1990 in all dimensions. In this table we include all of the 1990 level variables simultaneouslyin each regression model instead of individually as in Table 7. The results again confirm the previous findings.The Fstatistic for the first stage in this model is 15.55. We find robust positive effects of indirect electexecutives on income and labor force participation in the second stage results. There is also a negativeeffect on unemployment and on the percent with a high school diploma, but these effects are not statisticallysignificant.4.3.3 Different Institutions and Casinos A further potential confounder for the results obtained so far is that constitutions might differ along severaldimensions other than whether the executive is elected indirectly or directly. Potentially, other institutions contained within the tribal constitutions may be responsible for the observed differences in economic performance,while these additional institutions are themselves highly correlated with whether a tribe has a parliamentary orpresidential system of government. In order to account for these potential confounders, we include additionalpolitical institutions as right hand side control variables and investigate how this affects the results for themain outcome, changes in log per capita income. Table 9 presents results for second stage estimates usingextended specifications with controls for other components of the constitutions. In particular, the estimatesaccount for whether an independent judiciary exists or not, whether elections are staggered, for the lengthof an election term, whether a council is directly elected or not, and for the size of the tribal council. Theresults are robust to the inclusion of these additional variables, whereas none of the individual variables attainstatistical significance, except for whether the tribal council is directly elected. Even in this particular case, thecoefficient on the indirectly elected chief executive remains large in magnitude and statistical significance.1010We also attempted to instrument the different alternative types of institutions using the party of the US President at the time ofthe adoption of the constitution. The instrument is not strong for any of the potential variables such as the existence of a judiciary,term length, whether the council members elections are staggered, and the initial size of the tribal council. Overall, the instrument 18An additional explanation for the observed differences in economic performance across the two types oftribes may be the presence of a casino.In fact, one might suspect that the presence of a casino alone isresponsible for the improved economic performance. The results in Table 9 suggest that the inclusion ofwhether a tribe operates a casino or not as a control variable does not significantly affect the main coefficientof interest. This is consistent with the fact that there is a diversity of triballyowned enterprises on American Indian reservations. Casino operations are important, but they do not account for all of the economic activityon reservations. Overall, the results therefore confirm the earlier findings that the constitutional design interms of a parliamentary or presidential type of government has a significant effect on economic performance.4.3.4 Placebo Effects Finally, we conducted a series of placebo instrumental variables regressions, the results of which can be foundin Table 10 in the Appendix.In these regressions, we take the initial values of our control variables fromthe 1900 census as outcome variables. The six outcome variables are log population density per square mile,percent married on the reservation in 1900, percent in the labor force in 1900, average percent nonIndian onreservation in 1900, occupationalincome score in 1900 and percent literate in 1900. For each of these variables,the first column instruments for having an indirectly elected chief executive at the time of adoption of theinitial constitution. None of the coefficients are statistically significant. The second column for each variableinstruments for having an indirectly elected chief executive in their current constitution. Once again none ofthe coefficients are statistically significant.4.4 Predictions from Political Economy: Potential Channels The findings presented so far suggest that constitutional design has a robust causal effect on economic development. In particular, constitutions stipulating indirect elections of the executive that resemble parliamentaryforms of government appear to have a better economic performance than constitutions with directly electedexecutives in terms of the growth of average per capita income, labor force participation rates, postsecondaryeducated individuals and a reduction in unemployment rates on these reservations. These effects are not explained by other characteristics such as years since adoption, distance to the nearest city, or casino operations,nor through other facets of the political institutions such as the existence of an independent judiciary or staggered terms, nor by a systematic selection of tribes given the results of the placebo estimates. Nevertheless,the results so far leave open through which channels the form of government might operate to affect economicperformance.In this section, we explore several potential mechanisms that may be responsible for the observed differencesis only valid for predicting the method of electing the chief executive in the originally adopted constitutions. Empirically, wealso note that most of these institutions are added in later years as constitutional amendments and may be endogenous variablesthemselves.19in growth rates across the two different types of institutions. The political economy literature makes severalpredictions about the economic consequences of these different forms of state see, e.g., Persson and Tabellini,2000, 2003.A first assertion is that parliamentary systems tend to have expansionary bureaucracies and larger expenditures. Hence, one immediate candidate for a potential channel is the share of public employment intribal reservations, given that employment tends to be a primary concern on American Indian reservations. Inour particular environment, we find indeed that the expansion of government employment primarily tribalgovernment as federal employment Bureau of Indian Affairs employees had been steadily decreasing overtime on reservations as a likely candidate for explaining the improvement in economic conditions for American Indian populations residing on reservations.11 Table 11 presents results for the change in the share ofgovernment employment as proportion of the adult population on the reservation over the course of the 1990to 200509 time period as dependent variable. Column 1 presents the results for the second stage of 2SLSestimates when controlling for the employment composition in 1990. The results document that there is growthin government employment over this time period for tribes that were initially assigned parliamentary systems.In fact, there was a dramatic increase in business opportunities and the ability to operate existing governmentprograms such as education and housing services Wilkins, 2002, p. 89. A similar analysis with respect toemployment in the private sector does not reveal an accompanying improvement in business employment.It appears that the observed increase in per capita income and labor force participation between 1990 and 20052009 comes primarily from an increase in government employment. For American Indian reservations,this has meant an expansion of triballyowned businesses.We assert that this evidence suggests that the primary role for improved economic performance on American Indian reservations in this time period is due to improved employment prospects. Previously, economicopportunities on reservations had been quite sparse. New industries, in addition to casino and gaming operations, have sprung up on many American Indian reservations in the past twenty five years such as mining,energy production, timber, tourism and recreation, agriculture, hunting and fishing tourism, arts and craftsbased industries. Our findings, therefore, are consistent with a story where the most effective tribal governments expand their business operations and increase employment among tribal members. Compared to theaverage tribe with a presidential system, there is more government employment and, ultimately, the rate ofgrowth is higher and more sustained for tribes with an initial parliamentary system.A second assertion from the literature on comparative political economy is that parliamentary systems tendto have higher redistribution. Due to the lack of direct information about redistribution, we try to investigatethis assertion by considering the change in poverty. In particular, we construct a proxy of poverty: the share ofall households on reservations with an income below the contemporaneous median household income in the US11See U.S. Commission on Civil Rights 2003, page 11, Figure 1.2 which shows the decrease in per capita expenditures for Native Americans by the US Federal government relative to the US population as a whole over the past three decades.20as a whole. The result, shown in column 3 of Table 11, suggests that poverty declined faster in tribes withindirectly elected executives at the time of adoption of their constitutions.12 This corroborates the impressionthat incomes went up in the entire distribution, and in particular at or below the median, rather than only onaverage.Taken together, the results suggest that the parliamentary system is likely responsible for the observedimprovement in economic conditions. In the emerging democracies on tribal lands, with uncertain conditionsand preferences and a poorlydeveloped private business sector, it appears that a parliamentary system increased the governmentowned enterprises and was more likely to improve the economic conditions throughjob creation. The situation on American Indian reservations has generally improved over the course of thepast forty years as a result of a reduction in US Federal government control, better economic opportunities interms of leasing and development of natural resources.5 Concluding Remarks This research has used a novel panel data set of political institutions of American Indian tribal nations overthe 20th century. We examine the effect existing political institutions on economic development for individual American Indian tribal nations. The American Indian context is particularly useful for focusing on politicalinstitutions in several respects: the larger legal, political and economic environment is held constant as theyare located within the United States.In our analysis, we find that contemporaneous political institutionshave no effect on economic performance in an ordinary least squares regression framework. When using aninstrumentation strategy for political institutions that exploits the type of federal administration during theadoption of the initial constitutions, we find significant positive causal effects of parliamentary systems oneconomic performance. These results are robust to the inclusion of geographic and institutional controls, tothe inclusion of other potential constitutional features such as the existence of an independent judiciary orstaggering the tribal council election terms, as well as to casino operations. Results of placebo exercises donot indicate that there is systematic selection of tribes into particular constitutional types once accountingfor the instrumentation using the party of the US federal administration at the time of adoption of the firstconstitution. The results also suggest differences in policy, in particular in public employment, as a potentialchannel through which constitutional features affect outcomes.Overall, our results provide a first analysis of the causal effect of political institutions and accountability onlevels of economic development while holding constant a number of other important determinants of economic 12It is worth noting that the reduction of poverty is not due to a reduction in the overall poverty in the US as a whole, giventhat poverty levels in the US in terms of the population below the poverty threshold actually went up. Also, very similar resultsobtain when poverty is measured by the fraction of households with household income below 15,000 USD deflated to 1990 prices,which indicates a relative as well as absolute reduction in poverty in tribes with indirectly elected executives relative to directlyelected executives.21security and legal structure. While our analysis focuses on a very specific set of governments, our findingsmay have wider implications by suggesting the importance for studying the mechanisms behind the economiceffects of constitutional design.22References Acemoglu, D. 2005: Constitutions, Politics, and Economics: A Review Essay on Persson and Tabellinis The Econonmic Effects of Constitutions, Journal of Economic Literature, 434, 10251048.Acemoglu, D., D.
