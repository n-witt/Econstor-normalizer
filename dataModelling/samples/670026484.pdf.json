IZA Discussion Paper No. 5346 November 2010 ABSTRACT Urban Infrastructure and Economic Development: Experimental Evidence from Street Pavement We design an infrastructure experiment in Mexico to evaluate the impact of street pavement on housing values and household outcomes. We find that the provision of street pavement raises housing values by 16% and land values by 54%, according to professional appraisals. Using homeowner valuations, we estimate the impact of pavement on housing values to be 25%. At the household level, street paving increased the use of collateralbased credit and average loan size. Additionally, among households on paved streets vehicle ownership went up by 40%, while the number of durable goods augmented by 12% as a result of pavement. We provide compelling evidence that the mechanism explaining the durable goods increase is the credit channel: the raise in durable goods as well as in credit use was only present among households with access to financial services at baseline. This suggests that increments in the value of collateral are not sufficient to expand credit use in this context. Access to the financial sector is necessary for street pavement to be reflected in higher consumption of durable goods. Finally, we estimate the private gains to land plots on paved streets to be 109% of construction costs, which can have important implications for urban infrastructure financing.

The combination of this urban population explosion withlimited public funds accounts for a worldwide deficiency in urban infrastructure. Today,large portions of the population in metropolitan areas throughout the developing world donot benefit from basic urban equipment such as piped water, electricity, sewerage lines, andasphalted roads UNHabitat, 2003. Because those neighborhoods with the lowest levelsof infrastructure are home to a citys most impoverished residents it is crucial to betterunderstand the effects of urban infrastructure on economic development Napier, 2009.The importance of this issue has become increasingly evident over the past decade withthe advent and proliferation of largescale direct cashtransfer programs such as Progresa Oportunidades. The extensive evaluation of cashtransfer programs Skoufias, 2001; Gertler 2004 contrasts starkly with the lack of research into the merits of infrastructure for urbandwellers World Bank, 1994. We address this gap in the literature by means of a randomizedexperiment designed to gauge the impact of street pavement in the city of Acayucan, Mexico.1In 2006, in cooperation with the municipal government of Acayucan, we randomly selected from a preapproved set of streetpavement projects each defined as a contiguou setsof unpaved city blocks connecting with the citys pavement grid a subset to be treatedwith pavement. The streets in question lacked pavement but were fully occupied by privateresidences.Our work is the first to address, by the use of random assignment, the problem of selection bias inherent in infrastructure placement. This technique resolves the main endogeneityproblem encountered by any study focusing on the impact of infrastructure: a simple comparison of places with and without infrastructure in observational data is misleading, sinceinfrastructure is normally allocated to places that provide the highest returns Duflo and 1We use the American term cid:28street pavementcid:29 to refer to asphaltconcrete laid down for vehiculartraffic. The British English equivalent is cid:28road surface.cid:29 Acayucan is one of Mexicos 56 metropolitanareas, encompassing three municipalities with a combined population of 105,500 INEGI, 2007.1Pande, 2007; Van de Walle, 2002.We conducted a pair of household surveys: a baseline one, at the start of our study,in 2006, and a followup one once the streets had been paved, in 2009; in both instanceswe obtained professional appraisals of property values as well. Our experimental estimatesshow that street pavement generated substantial increases in the value of properties on pavedstreets: according to professional appraisals, residential property values increased by 16%,with a corresponding increase in land values of 54%. According to homeowners estimates,street pavement increased housing values by 25%. We corroborate the validity of thesemeasures with two other pieces of marketvalue information: rents increased by 31% inpaved streets; and for the houses that were purchased between the baseline and followupsurveys N 29 the price paid was 85% higher on paved streets, although the coefficientis insignificant p 0.49 on account of the limited number of observations. All of ourhousingvalue measures point towards substantial increases due to pavement provision.Since the provision of pavement did not affect either propertytax rates or propertyvaluations in Acayucan, our experimental valuation of street pavement is the first to measurethe willingness of householders to pay more for properties on paved streets. In this respectour study differs from that of Cellini, Ferreira and Rothstein 2010, who have shown that,when local public goods are financed with property taxes as is the case throughout most ofthe US, the marginal effect of publicgood provision on property values is, in the optimum,zero.Turning to householdlevel outcomes, we show that pavement had important positiveeffects on credit and durablegoods consumption. Collateralbased credit use from financialinstitutions more than doubled, and loan size went from an average of 150 pesos to 1,651 pesosper adult.2 Other forms of credit, including credit from family and friends or the government,did not respond to pavement provision. In terms of durable goods an important indicatorof household well being vehicle ownership among households benefiting from the provision 2 The 2009 PPP exchange rate was 8.5 pesos to the US dollar, and the nominal February 2009 exchangerate was 14.6 pesos to the US dollar.2increased by more than 40%, while the acquisition of household durable goods increased by 12%.Because we conducted our followup survey over a short period after the paving hadoccurred, we find no significant evidence of neighborhood recomposition. Furthermore, thosewho moved did not differ in their observable characteristics, such as per capita expenditure,durable goods, or vehicle ownership, according to whether the streets to and from whichthey moved were paved or unpaved.How did households manage to transform pavement into credit and eventually intodurablegoods consumption? We offer a simple but compelling answer: They could increasetheir use of credit and their consumption of durable goods provided that they had access tobanking services. Defining such a household as one in which in 2006 before the interventionat least one household member had a bank account, we find that increases in both credit useand durablegoods acquisition occurred exclusively among these households. This findingleads us to conclude that access to banking services is crucial to the positive relationshipbetween urban infrastructure and durablegoods consumption. This conclusion is consistentwith a large theoretical body of literature Aghion and Bolton, 1997; Banerjee and Newman,1993; Banerjee, 2004 and also with empirical evidence related to the expansion of branchbanks into rural India in the 1970s and 1980s Burgess and Pande, 2005; Burgess, Pande,and Wong, 2005.Given that street pavement generated considerable benefits for property owners alongpaved streets, we use the approach in Jacoby 2000 in order to compare the benefits ofstreet pavement the sum of increases in land values across plots with its costs and concludethat the benefits amounted to 109% of the costs. This suggests that in the absence of creditconstraints, property taxes triggered by public goods that increase land value could be usedas a funding device for this type of urban infrastructure.In sum, we show that urban infrastructure has a significant positive impact on the valueof residential properties, which is perhaps the most important indicator of household wealth;3that street pavement in particular has a significant positive impact as measured by the ratioof private landvalue increases to the cost of pavement; and that access to the financial sectoris crucial if households are to benefit from urban infrastructure in terms of credit use anddurablegoods consumption.Our work is related to the rapidly expanding literature on the effects of infrastructure.Donaldson 2010 provides evidence that railroad infrastructure increased trade between Indian districts, not only increasing average income but also reducing its volatility. Dinkelman2008 shows that rural electrification in South Africa has led to a reduction in the timewomen spend collecting firewood, allowing them to allocate more time to labormarket activities. Duflo and Pande 2007 find that the effects of irrigation dams in India depend onthe populations location relative to the dam: downstream, agricultural production rises andrural poverty falls; upstream, the situation is reversed.The structure of paper is as follows. Section 2 describes the experimental design. Section 3 presents the results. Section 4 provides an economic explanation for our experimental estimates. Section 5 compares the sum of gains in land value on paved streets with constructioncosts. Finally, Section 6 concludes.2 Experimental Design 2.1 Institutional Context Acayucan is an urban area with a development pattern typical of Mexico and other Latin American countries. That the benefits of municipal services including electricity, sewerage,tap water, street pavement, and public transportation diminish with distance from the citycenter is primarily due to the fact that public funding of such benefits cannot keep pacewith the citys population growth. Upon arriving at the citys outskirts, many of the poorermigrants have no choice but to purchase plots and build houses on tracts of land there,devoid of any urban infrastructure. With the passage of time, demand for basic services 4increases, as does the political pressure to provide them. The usual order is electricity first,followed by water and sewerage lines, and finally street pavement. While unpaved streetsare found throughout Acayucan, the highest concentrations are found near the citys limits.Municipal governments in Mexico are responsible for most of the elements of their urbaninfrastructure. Each threeyear administration has ample leeway as to budgetary allocations.The municipal budget consists mainly of transfers from general funds obtained from thefederal valueadded tax, the federal income tax, and oil revenues. Less than 10% of themunicipal budget derives from local taxes consisting of the property tax and businesspermitfees. Propertytax receipts, especially in small cities, play a less significant role in Mexicothan they do in the US. Cadastral property valuations are very low and rarely updated.Furthermore, in Mexico nonpayment of the property tax is not subject to prosecution onthe part of the municipal government concerned.2.2 The Experiment The 20052007 Acayucan administration launched a streetpaving program targeting thoseneighborhoods deprived of municipal services. Ideally, all unpaved streets would have benefited, but because of budget constraints the program had to be selective. Recognizing thatsuch selectivity could generate significant findings in regard to the costs and benefits ofpublicinfrastructure investment, we proposed to conduct a randomized evaluation of thispaving program.The administration decided to limit the program to those neighborhoods with relativelyhigh population densities. The administration was responsible for selecting and defining theprojects, which consisted of sets of contiguous city blocks that connected with the existingcity pavement grid. The mayor and the publicworks personnel provided us with a set of 56 such projects, located throughout the city. To qualify, a street had to be unpaved andheavily populated. Given that the administration could afford to pay for only 28 of the 56projects, the mayor and the city council reasoned that it would be in everybodys interest 5not only for a third party to evaluate the paving program but also for the same third partyto select, at random, the 28 streets to be paved. Thus in 2006 we used randomization tomake this selection.It is important to bear in mind that every municipal administration in Acayucan allocatesa portion of its budget to street paving. This means that any unpaved street has a positiveprobability of being paved, although it may mean waiting many years 15 was the medianin our sample. Treatment therefore did not modify the expectations of the control groupas to the likelihood of being selected in the near future. The novelty of our study relieson the randomization: within the subset of street projects that had the highest payoff tomunicipal authorities, we were allowed to randomize treatment. Figure 1 shows the locationof those streets assigned to the treatment group Z 1 and those assigned to the controlgroup Z 0. The projects range from 160 to 1,000 meters in length. Note that in Figure 2, a picture of one of the streets selected to be paved in 2006, the plots along the street arefully occupied by houses. For residential investment to take place prior to the provision ofpublic services is rare in developed countries, but extremely common in developing ones.Several sources of uncertainty that the city government would face throughout the courseof the paving project were: volatile funding, cost fluctuations, and foul weather, chiefly. By March 2009, 17 of the streets in the treatment group had been completely paved, two projectswere under way, and nine had yet to begin. The municipal government attributed the delaysto foul weather and various technical difficulties. On the other hand, the administrationdid fulfill the requirement of not paving those streets assigned to the control group. Thestreet shown in Figure 3 is the same as that in Figure 2, but after it had been paved. Theprovision of pavement in this context enhances the residents sense of inclusion in the citysidentity, and is also greatly appreciated not only for its aesthetic value but also its practicalimportance.The identity of the streets to be paved was not immediately revealed to the populationbecause budgeting is performed annually, whereas the study would take place over the three 6years of the administration. In other words, the selection was not legally binding in any waythat could be announced to the population, but rather served as an internal guideline in theannual budgeting process. Participation in the program was thus reveled to neighbors withthe arrival of measurement teams and eventually construction crews and machinery. Thishelps the research by eliminating anticipation effects in the housing values.2.3 Data Sources The data for this study are pre and postintervention rounds of a dedicated household surveythe Acayucan Standards of Living Survey, ASLS and professional appraisals of residentialproperty values.3 The baseline survey was fielded in FebruaryMarch 2006, and the followupsurvey was fielded in FebruaryMarch 2009. Professional appraisals were performed immediately after the survey work.The target population of the survey consisted of all occupied residential structures onthe streets that were selected for the experiment.4 The baseline survey was administeredto 1,231 households living in 1,193 dwellings, with a responserate of 94%.5 In 2009, 1,083households were interviewed. In 900 cases we found the same household that we had interviewed in 2006, and in 156 cases we found that a new household was in residence. In orderto assess neighborhood recomposition occurring on account of newcomers moving into newconstructions, all families living in residences built between baseline and followup were alsointerviewed N27. Table A1 details survey response rates.63 A full description of the ASLS can be found in GonzalezNavarro and QuintanaDomeque 2010. Wealso obtained information on business units from a brief business census conducted in 2006 and 2009.4 We created a sampling frame from all inhabited residential dwellings in January 2006. As Deaton 1997recognized, the use of outdated or otherwise inaccurate sampling frames is an important source of error insurvey estimates. The sampling procedure was clustered sampling: From the list of dwellings in each clusterwe chose at random a specified fraction to be interviewed.5 Some dwellings contained more than one household defined as a group of one or more persons living inthe same house and sharing food expenditures. The procedure in the case of such multiple households wasto interview all of them. It is worth noting that neither quota sampling nor substitution of nonrespondinghouseholds or individuals whether refusals or noncontacts was permitted at any stage.6 We determined that there was a risk that not all of the streets selected for treatment would in fact betreated by the time of the followup survey. Indeed, as we have seen in the previous subsection, there were 11 such cases. In order to maximize the power of our tests, sampling was done with a higher intensity in the 7The household questionnaire collects detailed information for each individual in thehousehold age, sex, educational attainment, labor supply, etc. and characteristics at thehousehold level per capita expenditure, durable goods, vehicle ownership, home investments, etc  In over 95% of the cases household and individual questions were answered bya reference person who was thus targeted because he or she was either the household heador the spousepartner of the head. It is important to emphasize that the municipality didnot announce to the population the existence of this study. Moreover, participants in thestudy household respondents and the professional appraiser were not aware of the ultimateobjective of the survey. We also trained field workers not to mention the phrase street pavement to respondents. Thus, any behavioral bias among the treatment group Hawthorneeffects and among the control group John Henry effects was minimized.In Table 1 we present descriptive statistics for the city of Acayucan in column 1, andfor the experimental streets in column 2.7 According to the 2005 short census Conteo,the municipality has a population of 79,459, with the city accounting for about 50,000. Theaverage altitude is 100 meters above sea level, and the climate is tropical. Of those aged 15and older, 9% are illiterate. School enrollment is 94% among adolescents aged 1214. Wateris piped to the lots or homes of 84% of households, and electricity to 98%. As for majorappliances, 81% of homes have a refrigerator, 55% have a washing machine, and 14% havecomputers.The descriptive statistics from the 2006 ASLS survey in column 2 are close to those of the 2005 census, with the exception of the proportion of households having access to piped waterin their lot and the number of rooms in the house, which are lower in our survey. These dataunderscore the fact that, while the indicators for census tracts with streets included in theexperiment are inferior to those for citycenter census tracts, the indicators of many areasintenttotreat group List, Sadoff, and Wagner, 2009. We sampled at a rate of 70% in the intenttotreatITT group and at a rate of 50% in the control group.7 The information in Table 1 refers exclusively to the city of Acayucan; it does not include nonurbanlocalities in the municipality or Oluta and Soconusco, the other two municipalities that are part of themetropolitan area.8that were not part of the experiment were even worse. The poorest families were living inareas dominated by vacant lots, and the municipal government could not as yet afford toprovide urban infrastructure to such underpopulated neighborhoods.2.3.1 Measuring House Prices The main challenge in assessing changes in property value occurring in small geographicalareas over a short time span is the paucity of transactions. Moreover, in the case of a developing country, transactions registered in the state property registry are unreliable indicatorsof transaction prices, since the term often used is gift, donation, or inheritance, in order toreduce taxes.8 Even for properties registered as having been sold, in many cases there is asubstantial lag between the date of the transaction and the date of registry. It seems thatin developing countries it is often the case that an individual buys and moves into a houseand only later pays the transaction taxes and registers as its owner. In the US, in contrast,property registries are the main data source for homeprice indices Case and Shiller, 1987.Again, however, these registries are useful for assessing changes in property values only overlarge geographical areas, such as entire cities.To compensate for the small number of transactions to be expected in our setting, we obtained two independent measures of property value: professional appraisals and homeownervaluations. The fact that professional appraisals are used by banks to determine propertyvalues, and hence the size of loans, indicates that they are a reliable source of market valuation. In our case, we used the services of a professional appraiser who was also a realestateagent in the city. We used the services of the same agent in 2006 and 2009 in order to minimize heterogeneity of assessment practices, which require subjective decisionmaking. Eachappraisal consisted of a visit by the expert to the property and a careful evaluation of the 8 Our conversations with local public notaries and municipal authorities revealed that since valuationfor propertytax purposes is set as the maximum between the last declared transaction price and the veryconservative propertytax assessed value, individuals do not usually report the actual amount paid for theproperty.9approximate sale price of the property.9 We obtained professional appraisals of residentialproperty and land value for half of the successfully interviewed households.10The second main source of property valuation we obtained were homeowners selfreports.Selfreported home values have long been used for research on housing economics in developed countries see Kish and Lansing, 1954; Kain and Quigley, 1972; Goodman and Ittner,1992; Kiel and Zabel, 1999; Bucks and Pence, 2006; in developing countries see Jimenez,1982. This literature concludes that the evolution of selfreported housing prices generallymimics that of actual prices. In the ASLS, we asked: Approximately how much money doyou think this house could sell for nowadays?For the 2006 ASLS sample, GonzalezNavarro and QuintanaDomeque 2009 have shownthat owners overestimate the value of their homes relative to the appraiser but that the biasis explained by long tenure: shorttenured homeowners provide value assessments that areon average the same as professional appraisals.11 This suggests the professional appraisersvaluation is a better indicator of market value.We can validate the professional appraisals and self valuations with the limited numberof market transactions data in our sample. We ask recent buyers those arriving betweenbaseline and followup how much they paid for the property. We ask recent renters howmuch they pay per month in rent. This last measure has the advantage that we can checkfor balance of the rent being paid on the same properties at baseline.9 Appraisers define market value as The most probable price, as of a specified date, in cash, for which thespecified property rights should sell after reasonable exposure in a competitive market under all conditionsrequisite to fair sale, with the buyer and seller each acting prudently, knowledgeably, and for selfinterest,and assuming that neither is under undue duress.10 On account of budgetary constraints we did not obtain appraisals from all interviewed homes. Theappraiser did not enter the properties because previous research has shown that doing so does not increaseaccuracy Kish and Lansing, 1954.0.39 for the whole sample, and only 0.04 for shorttenure homeowners.11 In the 2009 sample the mean difference between log appraised value and log homeowner valuation is 102.3.2 Credit and Consumption Measures The ASLS asks for credit use at the individual level for all adults. Credit use and loansize are available for collateralbased credit composed of mortgages, homeequity lines, andcollateralized bank loans; noncollateralized credit composed of appliance and furniturestore credit, bankcard credit, vehicle loans, and casas de cr edito popular loans; credit frominformal lenders, credit from family and friends, and credit from government entities. Inaddition, the ASLS asks whether anyone in the household has a bank account checking,direct deposit, or savings. Consumption of nondurable goods is measured by monthlyhousehold per capita expenditure. We have two measures of per capita expenditure: oneindirect measure, based on expenditures on eight major items food, phone, gas, electricity,education, rent or mortgage, clothes, and entertainment, and one direct measure, basedon total reported expenditures.12 Consumption of durable goods is measured according totwo indices: one of vehicle ownership the sum of automobile, truck, and motorcycle andone of household durables the sum of refrigerator, washing machine, microwave oven, airconditioning, video player, and computer.2.3.3 Other Measures The ASLS also contains information on labor supply households respondents were asked,for instance, to specify the number of hours each working adult worked per dayper weekand the income earned there from, transportation costs the time it takes to go to the citycenter using the habitual means of transport and the price of a taxi from the home to thecity center, health symptoms of poor health among household members over the previousyear, and childrens schooling school enrollment and absenteeism.12 Interviewers were asked to perform a consistency check permitting them to verify that total reportedexpenditures were at least as large as the sum of itemized expenditures.112.4 Identification In line with the established impactevaluation literature e.g., Kling, Liebman, and Katz,2007, we estimate intenttotreat ITT and treatmentontreated TOT effects. Let Y2009be the outcome of interest in 2009 and let Z be an indicator for pavementgroup assignment.We estimate Y2009 0 1Z 2Y2006 11where Y2006 is included to improve precision. The ITT parameter is 1 in equation 1.We estimate the TOT effect using pavement group assignment as an instrumental variablefor the street being paved, so Z is the excluded instrument for an indicator D of being pavedin the two stage least squares 2SLS estimation:Y2009 0 1D 2Y2006 2The TOT parameter 1 is equal to the ITT parameter divided by the regressionadjustedcompliance rate the fraction of observations that were finally paved among those originallyselected to be paved. We interpret these 2SLS estimates as treatmentontreated estimatesbecause paving was not applied to streets in the control group. In other words, there is onlyonesided noncompliance Bloom, 1984; Angrist, Imbens, and Rubin, 1996. The TOT isidentified under the assumption that there was no average effect of pavementgroup assignment on those households living on streets that were not finally paved we provide evidencebelow that this assumption holds. We cluster standard errors at the streetpavementprojectlevel and use survey weights.1313 Survey weights or expansion factors represent the inverse of the probability that a dwelling or householdis included in the sample. In constructing them we took into account the proportion of households whomwe attempted to interview in each cluster and clusterspecific nonresponse.123 Results Our dataset contains three types of households: those interviewed in 2006 and 2009; thoseinterviewed in 2006 but not subsequently because they moved out of; and immigrant households for which we only have information from the 2009 round. Table A1 shows that by thetime of the followup survey in 2009, 271 baseline households in our original sample hadmoved out, while 183 immigrant households not in our original sample moved into, theexperiments streets. We need to determine whether the attrition in our panel caused bythe baseline households that moved out is random. If it is, experimental estimates based onstayers will be consistent but imprecise; if it is not, the estimates will be inconsistent.The top panels in Table A2 and Table A3 show that neither outmigration nor immigration was affected by treatment status.14 Moreover, the lower panel in Table A2 shows thatwhen it comes to per capita expenditure, durable goods, and vehicle ownership there wasno difference between outmigrants from control streets and those from paved streets. Similarly, the lower panel in Table A3 shows that there was no difference between immigrantsinto treatment streets and those into nontreatment streets.15Given the shortterm nature of the experimental evaluation, we cannot prove that migration to and from experimental streets was mean independent of treatment status. Wetherefore do not rule out the possibility that over the long term the paving of a neighborhoods streets would cause a recomposition of that neighborhood.Having shown that our estimates are not inconsistent on account of outmigrantbasedattrition and that differential immigration flows to paved and unpaved streets had no maskedeffects, we turn our attention to stayers.14 The sampling frame in 2006 was occupied dwellings. In 2009, some of these dwellings may have beentemporarily unoccupied, hence the higher outmigration rate.15 Differences along other dimensions were also checked, with similar results.133.1 Baseline Balance Table 2 presents average baseline characteristics by treatment status for our main outcomevariables.16 The table shows that randomization was successful in balancing pretreatmentcharacteristics across both the intenttotreat and the control groups.17We assessed a total of 50 variables and found evidence of balanced characteristics acrossthe groups. The only variable that was significantly different was labor income in the ITTgroup, which was 17% higher than in the control group ITT0 at the 10% significancelevel.Table 2 also provides insightful descriptive statistics. Around 16% of households had abank account in 2006. Average expenditure per capita at baseline was 828 Mexican pesos,slightly higher than the poverty line, of 2 a day Banerjee and Duflo, 2007.18 At baseline,the index of household vehicle ownership sum of car, truck, and motorcycle is 21%, andthe average household has two out of the six items in the durablegoods category.3.2 Experimental Estimates 3.2.1 Effects on Home and Land Values We begin by presenting, in the three columns of Table 3, our main experimental estimates forthe effect of street pavement on home and land values. ITT and TOT estimated effects arepresented in the first two columns and the mean of the corresponding variable for the controlgroup in 2009 in the third. Using the professionalappraisal measures, we find that pavementincreased home values by 16% and land values by 54%. Using homeowners valuations,we estimate that street pavement increased property values by 25%. The fact that two 16 Additional outcomes can be found in Table A4 in the Appendix.17 An alternative test of equality of means is a two sample ttest with unequal variances between groupsusing Welchs 1947 approximation. This alternative provides a solution to the FisherBehrens problemof testing the significance of the difference between the means of two normal populations with differentvariances. The standard errors using this alternative test were very similar to the regression based standarderrors, so we follow usual practice. See Deaton 2009 for further discussion.18 This was the poverty line in 1985; by 2005 it had risen to 2.92.14independent measures of property value move in the same direction suggests that pavingaccounts for substantial increases in value.19To our knowledge, these are the first experimental estimates of the impact of this type ofbasic urban infrastructure on property values. With respect to the literature on hedonic estimates of the value of amenities see Rosen, 1974; the identification criticisms in Brown and Rosen, 1982; and Kanemoto, 1988, our estimates have an advantage in that we randomizedthe amenity at stake. Furthermore, given that homeowners who obtained pavement did notsee an increase in their property taxes, our estimates can be interpreted as the marginalwillingness to pay for this amenity. This contrasts with a situation in which identical neighbors vote on the amount of public goods to be financed by property taxes: in equilibrium,a marginal increase in the public good has no effect on average property values because thepublic goods valuation is exactly offset by the tax increase Cellini, Ferreira and Rothstein;2010.20Table 3 also shows that rents on treated streets were 31% higher than rents on controlstreets, controlling for rent paid by the previous renter for the same property, and that theprices paid for recently purchased houses on ITT and paved TOT streets are 44% and 85%higher than in the control group, although it must be conceded that, because the sample wassmall, this estimate is very imprecise. However, both supplemental indicators corroboratethe estimates obtained from appraisals and homeowner valuations, and even suggest thatthe most conservative impact estimates are those given by the appraiser.Identification of the TOT effect is based on the assumption that there was no averageeffect of pavementgroup assignment on those households living in places that were not finallypaved. One potential concern is that noncompliers, i.e., people living along the ITT streetsthat were not finally paved, knew that their street had been selected and modified theirestimates of their propertys value even before the streets were paved. The appraiser could 19 The difference in the magnitudes of the estimated impacts is not statistically significant. The standarderror of the estimated impact using homeowners valuation is three times higher than the one correspondingto the estimated impact using the professionalappraisal valuation.20 See also Brueckner 1982 and Haughwout 2002.15have updated his estimations of such properties as well. In any case, noncompliers wouldbe affected by owning a house on a street selected for paving in the near future, and beingin a selected project could not be used as an instrument for being paved. Table A5 showsthat there was no increase in home values for those homes in the intenttotreat group thatwere not finally paved, suggesting that the expectations of noncompliers regarding homeprices did not change.21Finally, we note that our estimates provide lower bounds of the effect on housing for twodifferent reasons. The first is the existence of indirect treatment effects. As long as distanceto the nearest paved street is a determinant of housing value, households in the control groupmay have benefitted from the pavement provided to the treated group. This would be thecase if a pavement project in the treatment group reduced the distance to the nearest pavedstreet for some homes in the control group.In fact, we observe an average reduction of 0.68 street blocks among the control group between baseline and followup, and increases inhome value among the control group that are correlated with the reduction in distance tothe nearest paved street Figure 4. This suggests that there may be a slight downward biasto our estimates of the impact on property values.Generalequilibrium effects, too, may help to account for a downward bias. The provisionof street pavement can be thought of as having increased the citywide supply of houses onpaved streets and decreased the citywide supply of houses on unpaved ones. Although thelatter commands higher prices than the former, the generalequilibrium effect is to reducethe price of houses on paved streets and increase the price of houses on unpaved ones. Tomeasure generalequilibrium effects something our experiment was not designed to do, oneshould randomize intensity of street pavement across otherwise similar cities.2221 This is also consistent with the local governments not announcing which streets were in the ITT group.22 In an attempt to assess the importance of these generalequilibrium and indirecttreatment effects, weestimate the following model for the group of homes in the control group ITT0:Y2009 0 1d 2C 3Y2006 3where Y2009 is appraisals home valuation in 2009, d is the change in distance to the nearest paved streetbetween 2006 and 2009 and C is an indicator of whether the home was located on a corner of a paved street,163.2.2 Effects on Credit and Consumption We now turn to the effects of streetpavement provision on credit use and consumption.Table 4 shows that pavement increased the percentage of individuals who use collateralbased credit from 2% among the control group to 5% among the treated. The increaseduse of collateralbased credit is also reflected in the average loan size, on average 150 pesosamong the control group and 1,651 pesos among the treated: a more than tenfold increase.While this is an important finding, we do not have the information needed to determinewhether the increase in collateralbased credit use is due to an increase in either the demandfor credit wealth effects or the supply of credit more approvals and higher authorizedloans.23When we look at all other types of credit, such as noncollateral based, credit from familyand friends, credit from government entities, and credit from informal sources, we do notobserve any changes either in the number of individuals using credit or in the extent of thecredit.24Consumption effects are reported in Table 5. Streetpavement provision had a strongpositive effect on the number of durable goods owned by the household: out of six durablegoods, control households had an average of 2.4 goods, while the mean for households onpaved streets was 2.7 goods 12% higher. There was also a significant effect on the rate ofownership of a motorized vehicle motorcycle, car, or truck. Whereas the householdvehicleindex is 0.25 out of three in the control group, in the treated it is 0.35, corresponding to athe idea being that a home that is on a corner where a paved street meets an unpaved one can be thought ofas having access to pavement. The indirecttreatment effect is captured with 1 and the generalequilibriumeffect with 2. Our estimates for 1 and 2 are 0.034 se0.026 and 0.009 se0.032, respectively. Onthe one hand, a decrease of one street block in the distance between a given house and the pavement gridwas correlated with a 3% higher housing value. On the other hand, the provision of street pavement wascorrelated with a reduction of 1% in the price of homes that already benefited from pavement on one sideof the house. In both cases one should bear in mind that it is difficult to estimate these effects with anyprecision.23 See Field and Torero 2004.24 In terms of access to the banking sector in 2009 determined according to whether someone in thehousehold had a bank account in 2009 we find a sevenpercentagepoint increase in bank accounts over acontrolgroup rate of 16%. The effect is close to being statistically significant.1743% increase.In Acayucan, as in many other cities in developing countries, households improve andexpand their houses over time.In terms of recent home investments, we find a doublingin the average number of home improvements a household engaged in over the previous sixmonths: from 0.4 to 0.8 reforms. The types of home improvements we inquired about relatedto flooring, plumbing, electrical installations, toilets, room remodeling, and air conditioning.Furthermore, the effect is confirmed by the 50% increase in the likelihood that the family hadbought materials for home improvements in the previous six months from 15% of householdsin the control group to 23% among the treated group.25Finally, we find that the provision of street pavement had no effect on monthly per capitaexpenditure, i.e., nondurable consumption, measured by the sum of itemized expendituresor a direct measure of total household expenditures.263.2.3 Effects on Transportation and Labor We now turn our attention from the impact of pavement on property values, credit, andconsumer activity to its impact on transportation and labor. In the city of Acayucan, wherethe terrain is hilly and the precipitation substantial, many unpaved streets are impassableexcept by pedestrians, especially during the rainy season. For this reason, and in spite of theshort period of time after paving streets, treatment may have reduced transportation costs.We measure the impact of street pavement on transportation costs in Table 6 in terms ofmoney and time: the cost of a taxi to the city center and the time it takes to go to the citycenter by ones usual means of transportation. We find that in both respects the savings forthose who benefit from pavement over the control group are neither large nor statisticallysignificant: a savings of half a peso on 18, and of one minute on 19. However our qualitativeresults point toward a reduction. Note that both the cost of a taxi to the city center and the 25 We did not find significant changes in the stock of home quality as measured by the sum of hard floors,cement walls and cement roofing.26 Note that we do not have financial savings measures.18time it takes to go to the city center are noisy measures of transportation costs. Indeed, aswas made clear by Mc Fadden 2007, the difficulty of accurately measuring transportationcosts poses a major problem for anyone attempting an empirical investigation into the roleof transportation in a wide range of economic activities.A further finding related to transportation is that household heads using motorized transportation private, taxi, or bus increased from 48% to 70% as a result of treatment. Thisfact and the possible reduction in transport costs in terms of time and money togetherprompted us to look at labor outcomes. While we find no effect on the extensive margin, wedo observe an increase in the number of hours worked per week: the ITT and TOT estimatesare 2.85 and 4.68 hours over a controlgroup average of 47. This increase is consistent with areduction in transportation costs and with the finding that plans on the part of a householdmember to migrate in search of work decreased by 10 percentage points, from 47% to 37%.If fewer people outmigrate in search of work, the citys labor supply may increase in thelong run. Finally, although reported labor supply increased in the treatment group, theincrease in working hours was not reflected in an increase in reported labor income, whichwas, according to the TOT estimate, a statistically insignificant 4.7%.3.2.4 Other Outcomes We found no evidence that pavement has an impact on health.27 We investigated this issuebecause we had observed that Acayucans lack of street pavement facilitates the accumulation of garbage, generates a dusty environment during the dry season, and during therainy season provides a fertile breeding ground in the form of stagnant water for the Aedes Aegypti mosquito, which transmits dengue fever.28 We asked individuals whether they hadsuffered any symptoms of disease, such as coughing, fever, and diarrhea; the selfreported 27 For evidence of the impact on health of the introduction of hard floors into homes in Mexico, see Cattaneo et al. 2009.28 There were 41,867, cases of dengue fever reported in Mexico in 2009, up from 27,479 in 2008. Of these,7,898 were of the hemorrhagic type. Acayucan is located in Veracruz, the state with the largest number ofcases of dengue fever.19results of our inquiry indicated that there was no correlation between disease and pavement.Similarly, humancapital accumulation measured by enrollment in school and absenteeismamong children did not vary according to whether the children lived on paved or unpavedstreets Table 6.A few of the properties on streets in the experiment were small businesses. We attemptedto assess the impact of pavement on these businesses by means of a short survey instrumentregarding the number of employees, sales, and expenditures. Table A6 business units section reports outcomes along the intensive margin at the firm level. The results show thatpavement status had no effect on the number of employees, sales, expenditures, or profits.29Table A7 investigates whether there was an impact along the extensive margin and reportsthe sum of business units in 2006 and 2009 by treatment status. Although there was agreater increase in the number of business units in ITT projects than in control projects,both in absolute and in percentage terms, these differences were not borne out in terms oftotal employment.We hypothesize that urban street pavement affected households but not businesses because most of the experimental streets, being in the outer areas of the city, could attractlittle if any consumer traffic. Moreover, because the businesses in these neighborhoods werelimited, for the most part, to grocery shops, the pavement, instead of encouraging shoppersto shop locally, may have made it easier for them to go downtown to do their shoppinginstead. Although this finding is consistent with previous findings in developed countries,we should emphasize that our business estimates suffer from lack of power.30 Moreover, onemust bear in mind that we are looking at shortterm effects, whereas it may be that theeffects on businesses as on neighborhood recomposition are longterm.3129 To determine if positive results were being masked by a temporary negative effect in streets recentlypaved due to street blockages during construction, we performed tests of differences in sales, expenditures,and profits according to an indicator for paving having taken place within the previous six months and priorto the previous six months and found no such differences.30 Haughwout 2002 shows that in the US the principal beneficiaries of infrastructure are property owners,not firms.31 One possible negative effect of the treatment could be an increase in the crime rate, since burglars wouldfind it easier to break into houses along paved streets. We inquired about crime victimization in terms of 203.3 Extensions 3.3.1 Heterogenous Effects Street pavements impact may depend on the proportion of paved streets in the area in whichpaving takes place. On the one hand, by the law of diminishing marginal returns, privatemarginal returns to pavement in a given neighborhood may decrease with the number ofpaved streets around that neighborhood; on the other, private marginal returns to pavementmay increase with the number of paved streets around that neighborhood if pavement in onestreet complements pavement in a contiguous paved one.In our data, there is heterogeneity in the proportion of paved streets abutting the streetprojects.In particular, we note that in the central area of the city, as opposed to theoutskirts, most streets were paved. In Table 7 we present separate estimates for the impactof pavement on home values for these two groups. We find that the effect of pavement isrelatively high in the areas with a relatively low proportion of paved streets; i.e., when thesurrounding streets are less likely to be paved, the impact of street pavement is higher. Thissuggests that the marginal private benefit of paving a street is higher in a lowpavementarea than in a highpavement area. This fact may be relevant for distributional concerns inpavementallocation decisions. However, note that this does not address the question of whatthe socially optimal allocation of pavement in this context is. For one thing, policymakerswould like to know if social returns are higher when paving some streets in all neighborhoodsrather than all streets in some neighborhoods.3.3.2 Multiple Testing In any experimental evaluation with multiple outcomes, significant effects may emerge simplyby chance. The larger the number of tests, the easier it is to make the mistake of thinkingthat there is an effect when there is none, i.e., Type I error. The problem is well knownburglaries and theft from and of vehicles but found no significant differences between the treated and thecontrol groups. Additionally, households along paved streets and those in the control group were equallylikely to feel safe while walking in their street at night see Table A6.21in the theoretical literature Romano and Wolf, 2005, and it has recently received someattention in the policy evaluation literature Kling, Liebman, and Katz, 2007; Anderson,2008.Multipletesting correction procedures adjust the individual pvalues for each outcome tokeep the overall error rate to less than or equal to the userspecified pvalue cutoff or errorrate. The default correction procedure is the Benjamini and Hochberg False Discovery RateBenjamini and Hochberg, 1995. It is the least stringent among the standard corrections,such as Bonferroni or Holm 1979, and provides a good balance between discovery of statistically significant outcomes and limitation of false positive occurrences. We have computed False Discovery Rates FDR using all three adjusted pvalues.32Our Benjamini and Hochberg pvalues show significant ITT and TOT effects on appraisedhome value, appraised land value, distance to the nearest paved street, cleanliness of thestreet, and household head using motor transportation to commute to work. All but thelast of these measures survive the Holm 1979 and Bonferroni corrections. Note that the Bonferroni correction is the most stringent test of all, offering the most conservative approachto control for false positives. However, it does so at the cost of a very high rate of falsenegatives outcomes are not statistically affected by the experiment when in reality theyare. The fact that we find statistically significant effects even under the most stringentmultipletesting corrections suggests that the impacts reported in this study are not due to Type I errors.32 Given R outcomes and their unadjusted pvalues, pr for each r 1,  , R, Bonferroni adjusted pvalues are calculated as Bpr minR pr, 1. Holm adjusted pvalues are computed by ordering theunadjusted pvalues for the R outcomes p 1 p 2   p R and calculating Hp 1 minR p 1, 1, Hp 2 minmaxHp 1, R 1 p 2, 1, Hp 3 minmaxHp 2, R 2 p 3, 1, etc. Finally, Benjamini and Hochberg pvalues also order pvalues p 1 p 2   p R and are calculated as BHp R p R, BHp R1 minBHp R, RR1 p R1, BHp R2 minBHp R, RR2 p R2, etc.224 Understanding Our Experimental Estimates Our experimental estimates reveal that the provision of street pavement increased the acquisition of household durable goods and motor vehicles. The increase in vehicle ownership canbe rationalized via the complementarity with street pavement and also by means of wealtheffects arising from the increase in property values. However, the increase in the acquisitionof household durable goods can only be understood a wealth effect.Given that we did not find clear evidence of increases in productivity we do not observeincreases in either wages or labor income the increase in durablegoods consumption mustbe due to increased credit use. In this section we present evidence consistent with the viewthat access to banking services was crucial in transforming the increase in property valuesinto durablegoods consumption.If the accesstobanking mechanism is operating, we should observe that pavement increased collateralbased credit use among households who had access to banking services butnot among those without it. Similarly, we should find that pavement increased the acquisition of durable goods and vehicle ownership among households who had access to bankingservices but not among those without it.We present evidence for this hypothesis in Table 8, where access to banking services ismeasured by whether someone in the household had a bank account in 2006, before theintervention. The table contains two panels. In the top panel we estimate ITT effects, whilein the bottom one we estimate TOT effects. The first three columns focus on credit, whilethe last three columns look at durable goods including vehicles.We start in the top panel by splitting the sample into households with and withoutaccess to banking services and estimate ITT effects on household collateralbased credit usein columns 1 and 2, and on household durable goods in columns 4 and 5. In columns 3 and 6 we estimate the following reducedform equation:Y2009 0 1Z 2X 3ZX 4Y2006 4223where X is an indicator of the households having a bank account in 2006, and the restof the variables are defined as in equation 1. In equation 2, 1 measures the ITT for allhouseholds, 2 captures differences in the outcome in 2009 associated with having a bankingaccount in 2006, and 3 is the difference in the ITT effect between households with a bankaccount and those without one. If our explanation is valid, we should find evidence that 1 0 and that 3 0.In the bottom panel, we split the sample again, and estimate TOT effects on householdcollateralbased credit use in columns 1 and 2, and on household durable goods in columns 4 and 5. In columns 3 and 6 we estimate by 2SLS the following equation:Y2009 0 1D 2X 3DX 4Y2006 53where we use pavementgroup assignment Z and its interaction with bank account in 2006 ZX as instrumental variables for the streets being paved D and its interaction witha bank account in 2006 DX. As long as the relationship is linear, evidence that 1 0and 3 0 would confirm our explanation, no TOT effects for households without bankingaccount, but positive TOT effects for households with a bank account.The first two columns in Table 8 show that the increase in collateralbased credit use dueto assignmenttopavement ITT and pavement TOT was concentrated among householdswho had a bank account as of 2006. The third column estimates the interaction effect ina single regression with the full sample, equation 2 in the top panel, and equation 3 inthe bottom panel. Only the interaction between assignmenttopavement or pavement andbank account in 2006 is significant. Similarly, in columns 4 and 5, the effect on durablegoods acquisition is estimated separately for the sample with and without access to bankingservices as of 2006. The coefficients show that only those households with access to bankingservices accumulated more durable goods once their street had been paved. This is confirmedin column 6, which estimates the interaction effect in a single regression with the full samplereduced form and 2SLS, in the top and bottom panels, respectively.24Table 8 demonstrates the existence of differential ITT and TOT effects for credit useand durablegoods acquisition across households depending on whether they had a bankaccount in 2006. These results provide strong support for the hypothesis that in order totransform the increase in property values derived from street pavement into durablegoodsconsumption, households need to have access to the banking sector.335 The Private Gains from Street Pavement If private benefits outweigh construction costs, property taxation may provide a viable avenuefor financing this type of urban infrastructure. Thus the finding of large returns to propertyowners prompts a comparison of construction costs with the sum of increases in land valuefor properties along paved streets.We measure construction costs as the sum of municipal expenditures on each street thatgot paved. Specifically, the municipality reported that the total cost of paving the streetsin this study amounted to 11, 304, 642 pesos. Following Jacoby 2000, and drawing on theprofessional appraisals, we calculate the benefit to the owners of plots that benefited fromthe paving project as the sum of increases in their value over that of plots on previouslypaved streets.34Table 9 reports the results of our analysis. There were 814 plots on streets that got paved.The average plot on these streets was valued at 27,844 pesos. Multiplying this value by theestimated impact of street pavement 54% gives an average benefit per plot of 15,081 pesos,for a total private benefit of 12,275,585 pesos. The last column shows that the increases inland values represent 109% of construction costs.Note that our calculation explicitly refers to private gains reflected in land values. Thisis not a full costbenefit analysis because we are not accounting for possible externalities ofstreet pavement see RossiHansberg, Sarte, and Owens III, 2010. Likewise, we are ignoring 33 This does not rule out that access to the banking sector may indicate financial knowledge or othercharacteristics of the household.34 An alternative strategy can be found in Kaufman and Quigley 1987.25the deadweight losses that would be generated by taxation.356 Conclusion Basic infrastructure is necessary for the adequate functioning of any economy. Despite anextensive effort in economics to analyze the effects of many types of infrastructure, endogeneity bias has always been a concern; it is difficult to refute the argument that comparisonsof places with and without infrastructure that are based on observational data can be misleading.In order to bridge this gap in the literature, we designed a unique streetpavement experiment in Mexico, the first to resolve the problem of selection bias inherent in infrastructureplacement using random assignment, and estimated positive experimental effects on homeand land values, the use of collateralbased credit, and the consumption of durable goods.The impact of streetpavement provision on home prices is estimated to be between 16%and 25%, and on land values around 54%. Individual collateralbased credit increased from 2% control group to 5% treatment group. Street paving increased the number of durablegoods owned by a household, from 2.4 to around 2.7, out of a total of six categories of durablegoods, as well as vehicle ownership, from 0.25 to 0.35, out of three possible motorized vehicles. The magnitudes of these effects are considerable, taking into account the shorttermnature of our evaluation.What is the mechanism behind these experimental estimates? We argue that householdson paved streets can acquire more household durable goods, as well as vehicles, becausepavement increases the use of collateralbased credit and its amount, through the increasein their homeland values, as long as they have access to banking services. Without access tobanking services, households cannot benefit from the increase in home values due to streetpavement in terms of collateralbased credit, and as a consequence they cannot acquire moredurable goods and vehicles. Our data provide strong evidence for this mediating channel.35 See Warlters and Auriol 2005 for estimates of the marginal cost of public funds in developing countries.26Weighing the increase in the value of land plots on paved streets against the municipalityexpenditures on each streetpavement project, we obtain an estimated privategainstocostsratio equal to 1.09. This positive ratio persuades us that the use of property taxation tofinance local public infrastructure is a fertile field for future research.What can we learn from this study? Public infrastructure, such as street pavement, hasa major impact on the value of a home, which in developing countries is perhaps the mostimportant of household assets, and on durablegoods consumption and vehicle ownership,important indicators of a households wellbeing. Even more importantly, we also found evidence that households must have access to the banking system in order to fully benefit frominfrastructure investments. If they do not, it is unlikely that infrastructure will be transformed into credit use and the acquisition of durable goods. Finally, this paper illustrateshow a research collaboration with a municipal government can allow for an experimentalanalysis of publicinfrastructure provision. In that sense, our findings encourage the replication of experimental infrastructure evaluations in other contexts. This would reveal to whatextent the observed causal effects in Acayucan are externally valid. If they are, the implications for the provision of local public infrastructure at the municipal level are of worldwidesignificance.27References Aghion, P., and P.

Thefact that there were 1,231 households in 1,193 dwellings in 2006 means that in some cases there wasmore than one household per dwelling. Completed at followup means that at least one member ofthe household was interviewed in 2006. New households means that no member of the householdwas interviewed in 2006. Subdivision means that in 2006 a household member created a newhousehold but occupying the same plot: for example, the son having got married, continued to livein his parents house but did not share food expenses with them. Substitutions means householdsencountered for the first time in 2009 who occupy the house inhabited by a family interviewed in 2006: for example, the house is rented.
