On the basis of an administrative data set a multilevel hazard rate model in discrete time for the transitions into a sanction is estimated, controlling for unobserved heterogeneity on the individual and regional level. It is shown that certain benefit recipients, e.g. younger people, are more likely to receive sanctions than e.g. older, disabled, or skilled individuals. Moreover, the risk of being sanctioned not only depends on individual characteristics but is also influenced by the sanction policies of the employment agencies. Zusammenfassung Der Beitrag untersucht individuelle und regionale Determinanten von Sanktionen, die Unterstutzungsleistungen arbeitsloser Leistungsempfanger in Deutschland mindern. Auf Basis von neu verfugbaren Geschaftsdaten der Bundesagentur fur Arbeit werden sanktionierte und unsanktionierte Leistungsempfanger verglichen. Zudem wird ein multivariates Abgangsratenmodell in diskreter Zeit spezifiziert, das unbeobachtete Heterogenitat auf individueller und regionaler Ebene kontrolliert. Dabei zeigt sich, dass Arbeitslose in ganz unterschiedlichem Mae von Sanktionen betroffen sind: Beispielsweise erhalten jungere Menschen unter 25 Jahren Sanktionen mit hoherer Wahrscheinlichkeit als Altere uber 50 Jahre, Schwerbehinderte oder hoch qualifizierte Leistungsempfanger. Das individuelle Sanktionsrisiko ist nicht ausschlielich vom Verhalten des Arbeitslosen, sondern ebenso von der Sanktionierungspolitik der regionalen Arbeitsagenturen abhangig.

As part of the reorganization of the unemployment insurance UI system the legal rules for benefit sanctions were amended in order to make the imposition of sanctions more effective in Germany. These changes in the sanction regime are part of a broader international trend to increase the pressure on UI benefit recipients and to activate them cf. Eichhorst et al., 2006 or Klammer and Leiber, 2004. Primarily due to data limitations so far little is known for the German case about the imposition of benefit sanctions and individual sanction probabilities. A descriptive study by Wilke 2004 based on individual data from the Employment Subsample of the Institute for Labor Market and Employment Research exemplifies the data restrictions as it cannot discriminate between benefit sanctions in a narrower sense Sperrzeiten and minor penalties that are in most cases revoked Saumniszeiten. Wilkes findings do thus not completely correspond to actual benefit sanctions that lead to a suspension of benefits. For instance, the result that most of the sanctions are withdrawn within a short period of time does not hold for benefit sanctions in the narrow sense as aggregate data on the share of revoked sanctions show cf. Muller and Oschmiansky, 2005. With the Integrated Employment Biographies IEB a new comprehensive administrative data set is available cf. Hummel et al., 2005. On this basis the paper aims to broaden the understanding of the imposition of sanctions. Focusing on UI benefit sanctions after the rejection of a job offer or a placement into a program of active labor market policy ALMP that lead to a suspension of benefits the following empirical questions will be addressed: What proportion of the newly unemployed individuals is actually receiving a benefit sanction? At which point in time during the unemployment spell are sanctions predominantly imposed? How does the composition of the faction of sanctioned unemployed differ from the group that has not received a sanction? What are the individual and regional determinants of the transition rate into a sanction? Which role does the sanction policy of the local public employment agency play for the individual sanction probability? The wider ranging and complex question concerning the labor market effects of sanctions will not be tackled in this short contribution, though. In order to answer these research questions I first analyze the transition rate from unemployment into a benefit sanction descriptively. Then a multivariate, multilevel hazard rate model in discrete time that also controls for nested unobserved heterogeneity is specified to investigate the individual and regional determinants of receiving a benefit sanction. It will be shown that the overall share of sanctioned unemployed is rather small. Only about one percent of newly unemployed benefit recipients receives a sanction that effectively reduces their benefits for at least 3 weeks. More sanctions are imposed in the first six months of the unemployment spell. The composition of the pool of sanctioned unemployed is markedly different from nonsanctioned benefit recipients: younger and lowqualified individuals are over, women, older, highlyqualified and disabled persons are underrepresented among the sanctioned. Unobserved individual characteristics of the unemployed also affect the probability of being sanctioned. Moreover, it will be shown that there is systematic regional variation in the individual risk of re 1ceiving a benefit sanction that cannot only be attributed to regional context conditions but also to the sanction policy of the respective employment agency. This means that benefit recipients in Germany are not being treated equally with regard to the sanction rules. The remainder of the paper consists of five parts. Section 2 briefly reviews the literature, discusses the theoretical background for the imposition of sanctions and formulates hypotheses. In section 3 the data base is described, the sample design is discussed and the variables of the empirical analysis are defined. Section 4 outlines the econometric model. The results are presented in section 5. Section 6 summarizes my conclusions. 2 State of the Literature and Hypotheses The monitoring of the unemployed and the imposition of benefit sanctions can be understood as institutional features of UI systems to reduce disincentive effects. The theoretical literature on optimal UI design dealing with the effects of sanctions cf. Fredriksson and Holmlund, 2003 tries to derive the optimal level of monitoring and sanctions given their costs and benefits. It is shown that sanctions can improve the incentive structure of UI benefit systems and increase the transition rate to employment Boone and Van Ours, 2000; Boone et al., 2001; Fredriksson and Holmlund, 2005. Incorporating sanctions into an UI system can be more efficient than an across the board reduction of benefits and is thus potentially welfare improving Boone and Van Ours, 2000. Empirical analyses on benefit sanctions are mainly concerned with their causal labor market effects on the transition rate from unemployment to employment. The direct incentive effect for those individuals who have received a benefit sanction is to be distinguished from the threat effect of a potential sanction that affects the reservation wage and search intensity of all unemployed benefit recipients. There is a series of papers based on experimental data for the U.S. cf. Meyer, 1995; Johnson and Klepinger, 1994; Klepinger et al., 2002; Benus et al., 1997 and Ashenfelter et al., 2005 and for Europe cf. Dolton and ONeill, 1996; Micklewright and Nagy, 2005; Gorter and Kalb, 1996; Jensen et al., 1999 and Van den Berg and Van der Klaauw, 2006. In addition, nonexperimental studies that draw on administrative data sets were carried out by Keeley and Robins, 1985, Lalive et al., 2005 and Abbring et al., 2005. Most of the studies conclude that sanctions exert a positive impact on the transition rate into employment. In several cases the imposition of a sanction is combined with more intensive counseling for the unemployed. Whereas in many theoretical models agents are assumed to be homogeneous i.e. everyone has the same sanction probability given his or her behavior, empirical analyses of the sanction effects have to account for individual heterogeneity to avoid selection bias in the estimated effects. I am not aware of any publications analyzing explicitly the determinants of benefit sanctions. Therefore this paper is focused on observed and unobserved factors on the individual and regional level that influence the transition process from unemployment into the state of an imposed benefit sanction. 2On the individual level a number of explanations can be thought of that are related to observable characteristics. First, a certain behavior of the unemployed may be related to their socioeconomic characteristics. Older people, for instance, tend to be more risk averse than younger persons. Since their employment options are generally limited, the elderly will be more inclined to accept a job offer or to participate in a labor market policy program and therefore will not risk a benefit sanction. Younger people could be more careless regarding the sanction rules and thus face sanctions with a higher probability. Second, institutional factors restricting the behavior and hence the sanction probability could also be relevant. Job search requirements and sanction rules are not implemented uniformly, but applied selectively, e.g. by age or family status. Older unemployed, single parents as well as disabled persons should thus ceteris paribus have lower inflow rates into a penalty. People with larger benefit entitlements ought to be sanctioned less often since they have a greater financial incentive to avoid a penalty. Third, the capacity of circumventing benefit sanctions may not be distributed equally. For instance, highly qualified persons could be more skilled and successful in avoiding sanctions which would lead to lower sanction rates. Fourth, to some degree societal norms may influence the decision of an employment officer not to impose a benefit sanction. One could imagine that individuals who are perceived to be not as flexible, e.g. older people or parents, will not be treated as strictly by the Public Employment Service PES as e.g. young singles. In addition to the described effects that are related to observable variables unobserved individual heterogeneity should also play an important role for transitions into a benefit sanction. Some individual characteristics e.g. risk aversion or work motivation cannot be observed but vary between individuals regardless of age, sex, etc. Some people could therefore engage in more risky behavior than others and thereby accept the higher probability of benefit sanctions. This may lead to different sanction rates between on the surface identical people. Institutional details of UI design see e.g. Grubb, 2000 and the implementation of sanctions, which both also affect the probability of receiving a benefit sanction, are neglected in most of the above mentioned literature. Muller and Oschmiansky 2005; 2006 have shown that there is considerable crossregional variation in the implementation of benefit sanctions in Germany. As sanction rules have to be executed by the PES, problems of policy implementation arise. Eventually a placement counselor decides if a job offer is suitable, or search requirements were violated and, therefore, a benefit sanction is warranted. In addition such decisions are constrained by the conditions on the regional labor market. This leads to regional differences in the monitoring and sanction intensity which have an effect on the individual probability of getting sanctioned. The following hypotheses can be derived for factors on the regional level. First, the situation on the regional labor market influences the sanction probability. The individual risk of getting sanctioned is higher when the level and duration of unemployment is low and the vacancy rate is high; otherwise there would not be many possibilities for rejecting job offers made by the PES that could ultimately lead to a sanction. Second, implementation variables will have an impact on the transition rate into a sanction. An employment agency that has relatively more personnel a favorable staffclientratio andor maintains a larger secondary labor market has more resources andor opportunities to impose benefit sanctions. 3Not least, the sanction policy of an employment agency is crucial: Benefit recipients living in an employment district where the local agency pursues a stricter activation strategy should have a markedly higher probability of benefit sanctions. 3 Data Set, Sample Design and Definition of Variables This study uses a new individual data set, the Integrated Employment Biographies IEB from the German PES see Hummel et al., 2005. Originating from four different sources this administrative data contains register data on unemployment insurance and assistance benefits, the participation in programs of ALMP, and employment registrations covered by the social security system. It comprises all individuals who are either registered as unemployed or officially searching for employment. The data are merged by means of the social security or the PES customer number. This spell data set consists of information about different employment states and the transitions between those states on a daily basis. The IEB does not record data about certain labor market states like self and civil employment or being out of the labor force. As notifications from the employers about new employment contracts can arrive delayed there are data gaps for the latest year included in the IEB. Quarterly inflow samples are used for the years 2001 and 2002 which are randomly drawn from the population of unemployed individuals receiving unemployment insurance or assistance benefits and therefore being at risk of getting sanctioned for more details see WZB and infas, 2006. Samples were drawn and estimations carried out separately for both sexes as well as for East and West Germany. For the empirical analysis benefit sanctions in the sense used here have to be distinguished from several short term penalties maximum of seven days, including penalties for a missed appointment with an employment officer Saumniszeiten, and from the socalled Minderungsbetrage, when benefits are reduced due to a late registration as unemployed. The focus here is thus solely on temporary suspensions of benefits Sperrzeiten which entail the following types of penalties: the rejection of a reasonable job offer from the PES 144 I, No. 2 SGB III and the refusal to participate in programs of ALMP 144 I, No. 3 SGB III. These cases correspond to the theoretically interesting types of sanctions for already unemployed benefit recipients which are intended to reduce adverse incentive effects of the UI. The dependent variable is the individual transition rate from unemployment to a benefit sanction in the form of a temporary suspension of benefits. Only those cases are recorded as effective sanctions that are followed by a period of 20 days without benefit payments. This condition guarantees that a benefit sanction of at least 3 weeks was not only imposed but also implemented insofar as payments were actually suspended. If this is not the case either an objection was entered and the sanction was lifted or any type of shorter sanction was imposed. In constructing the sample only those cases are considered that are actually at risk of getting sanctioned. Leaving the state of unemployment, e.g. transitions to employment or into a labor market program as well as outflows from benefit reception for other reasons lead to rightcensored cases. 4Independent variables on the individual level are socioeconomic characteristics like sex, age, level of qualification, disabilities, nationality, benefit level, children younger than 3 years in the household, and more than 2 children in the household. In order to model the labor market and unemployment history of individuals the cumulated duration of previous unemployment spells is calculated before the individual enters unemployment at the beginning of the observation period. Moreover, dummies for the incidence of benefit sanctions and other types of shorter penalties before the inflow into unemployment in the observation period are specified. The latter two might capture to some extent unobserved individual heterogeneity and shall give an indication, whether the individual is prone to receiving different kinds of penalties. One has to be aware that if they are correlated with the stochastic process of getting sanctioned these dummies are not completely exogenous. The independent variables are partially timevariant and denoted by xtij in the methodological section 4 for details see WZB and infas, 2006. The descriptive statistics are discussed in more detail in subsection 5.1 see Tab. 2 below. In addition aggregate data on the regional level of employment agencies are utilized. These data are available on a monthly basis for the years 20002004 and can be matched with the individual IEB variables. The covariates denoted by xtj that are used to model the regional labor supply and demand are the regional unemployment rate, the average unemployment duration and the vacancy rate. Moreover, implementation indicators like the personnel resources of the agency and the size of the secondary labor market are included in the model for definitions see Tab. 5 and for descriptive statistics Tab. 6 in the Appendix. I did not include the regional sanction rate as a proxy variable for the sanction policy of the employment agency. Its coefficient could not be interpreted as this variable would be endogenous: the dependent variable would also appear in the regional sanction rate on the righthand side. Therefore unobserved heterogeneity at the regional level is analyzed explicitly. 4 Econometric Model . xtexpxtAn empirical reducedform model cf. Neumann, 1997 is specified to analyze the determinants of the hazard rate from unemployment into a sanction which is assumed to have the following continuous time representation: 1 . is the transition rate from unemployment into an effective sanction. It is a function of the time variable t denoting the elapsed duration since entering the state of unemployment and conditioned on observed covariates x. . is assumed to have a Proportional Hazards PH specification given the vector x see Lancaster, 1990; Jenkins, 2005. The term t symbolizes the baseline hazard function depending on t but not on x and is assumed to be common to all persons. The individualspecific and nonnegative function expx scales the baseline hazard. Therefore this specification is also known as multiplicative hazard model. Proportionality means that absolute changes in x imply proportionate changes in . at each t, moreover the effects of x are assumed to be constant over time. 5Although it is often impossible to justify the PH assumption on theoretical grounds cf. Neumann, 1997, these types of models have been popular in applied research Devine and Kiefer, 1993. Van den Berg, 2000 shows that under certain assumptions a PH specification can be derived from economic search theory. In the subsequent analysis . is modeled in discrete time cf. Allison, 1982 for the following reasons: First, the baseline hazard rate can be specified very flexibly see below. This means that the assumption of proportionality needs only to hold in smaller time intervals. Second, as time is observed in discrete units there would be a number of ties in a continuous time model. Third, it is easy to incorporate timevarying covariates. The continuous time IEB data set is thus expanded into the personperiod format generating monthly time intervals see e.g. Jenkins, 1995. The discrete time representation of the proportional hazards function . is referred to as the complementary loglog model see e.g. Singer and Willet, 2003 or Kalbfleisch and Prentice, 2002 and looks like follows: 2 1expexp1xth,t 2 . xxxtijtij,tjt 0tjThereby ht. represents the discrete time hazard rates at the end of the respective time interval and t is the difference between the integrated baseline hazard rates at the beginning and the end of the interval see e.g. Jenkins, 2005. The threefold indexing represents the 3level structure of the discrete time data see e.g. Goldstein, 1995 for similar models distinguishing: t1,2, , T time periods measured in months for each individual, i1,2, ,N individuals and j1,2, ,141 West German as well as j1,2, ,40 East German employment districts. Two types of explanatory variables are incorporated into the model. The matrix xtij contains observable individual characteristics whereas xtj includes observable regional covariates like the level and the structure of unemployment, the number of vacancies or the personnel resources of the employment agency which should also influence the individual probability of a sanction. The variables, both in xtij and xtj, may also vary over time see section 3. The functional form that characterizes the duration dependence is modeled flexibly using a piecewise constant specification. This means that the baseline hazard is assumed to be constant within groups of months whereas the hazard can differ between these groups. This is technically realized by the inclusion of a set of dummy variables into the model that are equal to one in the respective time period and equal to zero otherwise Kalbfleisch and Prentice, 2002; Lancaster, 1990. The baseline hazard is given as follows: expexp3  DD . 122t 1D1ttht JJt In most applications unobserved heterogeneity is only considered for the individual level. In section 2 it was mentioned that important individual characteristics are unobserved and not included in xtij. The same is true for unobserved variables at the regional PES agency level especially a PES agencys sanction policy which are not captured by xtj. As argued in the theoretical considerations above unobserved factors on the regional PES agency level e.g. due to differences in policy implementation and PES performance may also influence the sanction intensity and therefore the individual sanction probability. If those factors are ignored the baseline hazard and parameters for xtij and xtj are biased and 6inconsistently estimated in 2 cf. Heckman and Singer, 1984a or Lancaster, 1990. Moreover standard errors in such models are underestimated. For this reason the terms vij, vj, are incorporated into the empirical model representing unobserved heterogeneity at the individual and the regional level. These heterogeneity terms are assumed to be constant over time. Following Heckman and Singer 1984b a nonparametric approach is chosen to model timeinvariant unobserved heterogeneity at the individual vij and the regional vj level. It is specified as an arbitrary discrete distribution with a set of mass points. These locations are estimated freely whereas individual probabilities of being located at each point are attached to them. For the example of two heterogeneity classes at the individual level denoted by a and b vij has the values vijvija,vijb with probabilities Prvijapa and Prvijbpb1pa. If there are also two classes at the regional level denoted by c and d, then vj has the values vjvjc,vjd with probabilities Prvjcpc and Prvjdpd 1pc. It is assumed that vij and vj fulfill the following conditions: L 1jmv4 Pr Pr , , M 1vxv Ejl Prjm , 1jmijt Prijmvvijt 0jmijll 1Lijlvl 1xv Eijlijlvv Em 1v Mm 1jt , 1xv Eijl . xv Ejl0 and jt Unobserved heterogeneity is then introduced into the duration model by allowing the intercept 0 to vary between different types of individuals and regions. It is replaced by vij, vj see Sastry, 1997 for a similar model. The hazard function including individual and regional heterogeneity terms looks like follows: x5 1expexpxt,vvxx. ,1tij 2tjijjhtijtijtjt Since an inflow sample is used, the individual likelihood contribution for a rightcensored spell equals the discrete time survivor function: 6 LiPrTitt Sitk11hki. For the completed spell it is given by the discrete time density function see Lancaster, 1990 or Jenkins, 2005: 7 LiPrTitfitt Shtii1htihti 1tk 11h ki The overall likelihood results from the product of individual likelihoods. After incorporating the above outlined heterogeneity terms and rearranging the following overall sample likelihood can be derived: 8 Lnbd alcmi 1pmlhlmtihlmti 1itk 11hlmki. 7Thereby i symbolizes a censoring indicator with the value i1 for complete, and i0 for rightcensored spells. The hazard function from 5 is then plugged into 8, logs are taken for computational simplicity and the model is estimated with the help of the program package Gllamm see RabeHesketh et al., 2004 which is implemented in Stata. 5 Empirical Results 5.1 Descriptive Statistics Basic statistics for the IEB data samples are provided in Tab. 1 for the inflows in 2001 and 2002. The inflow samples contain a total of about 80,000 spells per year. An effective sanction which suspends benefit payments for at least 20 days is imposed in 1.2% West and 0.5% East of all inflow spells. This small share is consistent with aggregate administrative data for Germany where the rate of imposed sanctions in relation to all inflows of unemployed is also around 1%. Abbring et al., 2005 who utilize a comparable data set report similarly small numbers whereas the higher share of sanctions in comparable Suisse data reflects a much stricter sanction regime in this country cf. Lalive et al., 2005. In addition Tab. 1 shows that in West Germany a slightly higher share of sanctions is imposed during the first six months of the unemployment spell. After that the transition rate into an effective sanction steadily declines with the elapsed unemployment duration.

Sources: The descriptive comparison between spells of sanctioned and nonsanctioned unemployed shows considerable differences with respect to several individual characteristics from which a profile of the sanctioned unemployed can be derived see Tab. 2. Women receive a benefit sanction less frequently than men. Highly qualified unemployed are also clearly underrepresented in the group of unemployed having received a benefit sanction. Moreover, older and disabled unemployed get a benefit sanction less frequently than their respective comparison 8groups. In East Germany older unemployed are sanctioned a little more often compared to the West. The most overrepresented group among newly unemployed persons receiving a benefit sanction are younger individuals below the age of 25 years whose portion in West Germany is more than 40% and nearly 50% in the East. The share of younger persons in the comparison groups is only 20% respectively. Between 2001 and 2004 the share of younger individuals among sanctioned unemployed increased by 10 and 15 percentage points in the West and East respectively results not shown; cf. WZB and infas, 2006. Unemployed with no formal qualification receive a sanction much more frequently than qualified people. Immigrants are sanctioned with an aboveaverage frequency only in West Germany.

Sources: Moreover, the sanction probability seems to decrease with a higher level of benefit payments. The average benefit level per day of a nonsanctioned unemployed amounts to 24 West and 20.5 East, whereas the sanctioned unemployed received 19.5 West and 16.5 East per day. This discrepancy can partly be explained by the different socioeconomic composition of both groups. Only in West Germany sanctioned unemployed have experienced slightly higher unemployment durations over the last five years before the observation period. Individuals who get a benefit sanction had on average more often been hit with a benefit sanction prior to the observed period. This group had also experienced more shortterm penalties in the past. The latter applies for Germany as a whole. 5.2 Results from Hazard Rate Models Multivariate hazard rate models are specified to investigate the determinants of the imposition of benefit sanctions. To make the estimations computationally feasible stratified subsamples had to be drawn from the original samples. This explains the smaller number of observations. The results are based on the inflows into unemployment for the years 2001 and 2002 and given in Tab. 3 and 4 as 9well as Tab. 7 to 12 in the Appendix. All models were estimated separately for men and women and for West and East Germany. In all tables the coefficients for the models without and with unobserved heterogeneity are reported to emphasize the relevance of accounting for unobserved factors. Ultimately, the coefficients together with the hazard ratios from the full model with unobserved heterogeneity are shown to discuss the direction and size of the estimated effects. With respect to observed individual characteristics of the sanctioned unemployed the basic patterns that emerged from the descriptive analysis are confirmed in the multivariate models. Not all relationships remain statistically significant for East and West Germany, though, if other observed and unobserved factors are taken into account. The results show that younger unemployed 25 years clearly get sanctioned with an aboveaverage probability, if other observed and unobserved factors are taken into account. The positive coefficient is consistent and statistically significant for most of the observed inflow cohorts. This effect is also fairly substantial: for young males in West Germany who entered unemployment in 2001 the hazard ratio is nearly five times higher than for males above the age of 25 see Tab. 3. For females of the same inflow cohort this effect is considerably larger; the hazard ratio for women below the age of 25 is 16 times higher than for older females see Tab. 4. For the inflow cohorts 2002 the effect size diminishes and becomes insignificant for men. In East Germany the same relationship is statistically significant only for women with a similar magnitude see Tab. 7 to 12. The descriptive findings suggested that lowqualified individuals receive more sanctions. This relationship is not confirmed in the multivariate analysis holding all other factors constant. For males the variable remains insignificant throughout the estimations. For females in West Germany the effect is slightly positive whereas it becomes negative in the models for East Germany when unobserved heterogeneity is introduced. It seems that being lowqualified does per se not increase the individual risk of getting sanctioned. On the other hand older 50 years and disabled benefit recipients as well as individuals with a university degree are confronted with a lower risk of being sanctioned. These relationships are consistent for men and women in East and West Germany and statistically significant in most of the estimations. The negative effect is the largest for older individuals: in West Germany the hazard ratio of older men is for the 2001 cohort only 10 percent and for the 2002 cohort only 1 percent compared to all other men see Tab. 3 and Tab. 7. For males in East Germany similar effects are found whereas the coefficient for females in West and East Germany have the same sign and a comparable size but are only weakly significant. Disabled males have similarly small hazard ratios compared to the reference group. The results are not as robust as for the elderly because the number of cases is considerably smaller, especially for females and in East Germany. Possessing a university degree reduces the sanction probability significantly only for men in West Germany, if other factors are controlled for. The hypotheses regarding individual characteristics seem to be confirmed in those cases. The imposition of benefit sanctions is highly selective and depends on the age, qualification and health of the unemployed. It appears, however, that the existence of children in the household does not influence the imposition of benefit sanctions as neither the coefficient for young children nor for a higher 10number of children turns out to be significant in any of the models. As expected the benefit level is negatively related to the imposition of sanctions in West and East Germany. The relationship is consistent over different inflow cohorts and regions but only statistically significant for the West German men in 2001.

The differences in the sanction rate with regard to observable socioeconomic characteristics can also be illustrated graphically by plotting predicted sanction probabilities for different unemployment durations and diverse subgroups of the sample.

Clearly, for both men and women it holds that individuals who are younger than 25 years of age have aboveaverage sanction probabilities. Older persons above the age of 50 years, however, are practically in no danger of risking a penalty. Their predicted transition probabilities lie way below the average and are nearly zero. One has to keep in mind that these group effects are modeled to be constant over time. The group differences must not be interpreted as timevarying effects. The overall discrepancy in the sanction probability is the difference between the areas under both functions. In Fig. 2 the same graphs are drawn for low and highly qualified people. The predicted probability of getting sanctioned for individuals without a formal qualification is markedly higher than for persons who have a university degree. The difference can mainly be attributed to the small sanction risk for highly qualified individuals whereas the sanction probability for lowqualified persons ranges only slightly above the average for all men or women. Fig. 4 to Fig. 9 in the Appendix demonstrate that these patterns are also valid for the inflow cohorts of the year 2002 and East Germany.

Its positive effect on the sanction probability is robust for males and females as well as for different inflow cohorts cf. WZB and infas, 2006. The size of the effect is considerable: The hazard ratio for males in West Germany who had received a sanction before they entered unemployment during the observation period is two times higher than that of previously not sanctioned men. For women the effect is markedly higher: for the 2002 inflow cohort the hazard ratio of previously sanctioned women is ten times, for the 2001 inflows more than 100 times higher than for the not sanctioned unemployed see Tab. 3 and 4 as well as Tab. 7 and 8 in the Appendix. Two important caveats have to be made here. First, the large size of the effect for women should be seen in the light of a relatively low number of observations. Second, the substantial interpretation of this variable remains somewhat vague. As discussed in section 2 above certain unobservable characteristics should affect individual sanction probabilities. These factors might be captured in this variable which is why one does not measure the causal effect of previous sanctions on the incidence of current sanctions. Note that there is no such consistent pattern in East Germany see Tab. 9 to 12 in the Appendix. With the sanction probability being generally lower and labor market conditions more tight a recurrence of sanctions is relatively seldom. The same positive relationship does in general not hold for other types of short penalties whose coefficients are insignificant in most models. Apparently these types of misconduct like missing an appointment or registering too late happen rather randomly and are not related to the sort of misbehavior that is followed by a real benefit sanction. With regard to the observed covariates on the regional level some of the expected relationships are reflected in the empirical results. The coefficients of the average unemployment duration show negative signs and are statistically significant in most models. For example, if the average unemployment duration in the region increases by one week the hazard ratio for the female inflow cohort of the year 2001 is only about 10 percent as high as before see Tab. 4. Moreover, the vacancy rate and size of the secondary labor market are positively related to the imposition of benefit sanctions and significant in some of the estimations as they present opportunities to impose penalties. In general the likelihood of receiving a benefit sanction is greater under more favorable labor market conditions, i.e. a lower level and duration of unemployment and higher demand for labor. Finally, note that unobserved heterogeneity is clearly present in the data with respect to the transition process from unemployment into a benefit sanction. The freely estimated heterogeneity terms 1, 3 on the individual and on the regional level are highly significant throughout the various models. The coefficients of the covariates, their standard errors and the overall likelihood change considerably when heterogeneity is introduced compared to a model without heterogeneity. In all estimations the model which includes unobserved heterogeneity is clearly favored according to Akaikes information criterion see Tab. 3 and 4 as well as Tab. 7 to 12 in the Appendix. On the individual level this confirms the hypothesis that in addition to observable individual characteristics some unobserved factors like motivation or risk aversion are at play determining the individual sanction probabilities. The results show that given the observed covariates there are two groups of individuals with high and low sanction probabilities. 14Moreover, the significant heterogeneity terms on the regional level suggest that groups of agencies differ with regard to the sanction probability after observed and unobserved individual as well as observed regional factors are controlled for. This finding supports the hypothesis that aside from his or her socioeconomic and behavioral characteristics the UI benefit recipients place of residence influences the probability of being sanctioned. Aside from unobserved context variables a plausible explanation would be an uneven imposition of benefit sanctions in Germany which confirms previous results from implementation research cf. Muller and Oschmiansky, 2006. The individual probability of receiving a benefit sanction is therefore also influenced by the sanction policy of the local employment agency. Again, it is possible to illustrate this effect by way of plotting predicted transition probabilities which are conditioned on different values for the heterogeneity terms on the regional level see Fig. 3. Thereby the other individual heterogeneity terms are conditioned to be equal to zero.

In Fig. 3 it is shown that falling into a group with a higher sanction probability significantly increases the individual probability of receiving a benefit sanction. For the West German inflow cohorts from 2001 the risk of getting sanctioned ceteris paribus increases by factor three if an individual would move from the group of agencies with a low sanction rate into an agency with a higher sanction rate. This is a substantial difference and indicates that benefit recipients from different agencies may not be treated equally over different employment agencies. 6 Conclusions This paper investigated the individual and regional determinants of UI benefit sanctions in Germany utilizing a newly available and very rich individual data set from the German PES. On the basis of descriptive statistics and a multivariate hazard rate model that controlled for unobserved heterogeneity on the individual and regional level the individual transition rate from unemployment into a sanction was analyzed for inflows into unemployment between 2001 and 2002. Only sanctions after the refusal of a job offer or the rejection of a placement into a 15measure of ALMP which carried an effective reduction of benefit payments were considered here. It was shown that the overall incidence rate of sanctions is rather small. Most of the benefit sanctions are imposed in the first six months of the unemployment spell. The descriptive statistics illustrated the differences between the groups of sanctioned and nonsanctioned individuals with respect to individual characteristics. Younger unemployed 25 years are noticeably, and to a lesser degree also lowqualified people, overrepresented in the pool of sanctioned unemployed. On the contrary, women, older unemployed 50 years and disabled persons have a lower share in the group of the sanctioned compared to all other benefit recipients. Most of the theoretically derived hypotheses are reflected in the empirical results, if observed and unobserved factors on the individual and regional level are taken into account in a discrete time hazard rate model. Among the sociodemographic characteristics the age categories, especially the one for younger unemployed, remain statistically significant determinants of the imposition of benefit sanctions for West and East Germany. Apparently younger benefit recipients face a higher, older unemployed a markedly lower risk of getting a benefit sanction. Another cleavage in the risk of getting sanctioned is constituted by the level of qualification. Individuals who possess a university degree have ceteris paribus a significantly lower sanction probability. If other individual and regional factors are held constant, persons without a formal qualification are sanctioned only slightly more often than the average individual. Moreover, as was expected, disabled persons have a significantly lower risk of being sanctioned by the employment agency. Another very strong individual determinant of benefit penalties was found to be the previous incidence of benefit sanctions over the individuals labor market history. This was interpreted as an indication that unobserved behavioral characteristics like risk aversion or conformity to the rules may influence the individuals sanction probability. That would mean that the group of sanctioned individuals differs from other unemployed with respect to its labor market behavior as suggested by previous theoretical and empirical research. Other types of shorter sanctions are not consistently related to the benefit sanctions that were considered here. Those breaches of rules seem to happen rather randomly. Moreover, it was demonstrated that, having controlled for all observed factors and unobserved heterogeneity on the individual level, there are groups of employment agencies with either high or low sanction probabilities. This could be explained by unobserved context variables. It is plausible, though, to partially attribute these differences to a systematic variation in the implementation of the sanction rules. That means that a persons individual probability of receiving a penalty also depends on the sanction policy of the local PES agency. People who live in employment districts with a stricter sanction policy are indeed sanctioned more often. This means that unemployment benefit recipients are not treated equally with regard to the sanction rules. The question which follows from this result is, if a higher regional sanction rate increases the inflow into employment which could justify such inequalities? This more complicated issue concerning the labor market impact of sanctions could not be tackled in this paper and remains thus a question for future research. 16References Abbring, Jaap H.; Van den Berg, Gerard J. and Van Ours, Jan C. 2005, The Effect of Unemployment Insurance Sanctions on the Transition Rate from Unemployment to Employment.
