Introduction Household structure is an interesting area for crossnational study for several reasons. Crossnational differences important differences between societies: in culture and norms; in the cost and availability of housing; in the economic means available to different groups in society; and in social policy, where differences in tax and benefit regimes may lead to radically different patterns of household structure. in household structure reflect Household structure is also interesting in terms of its relationship to a number of important outcomes. Poverty, for example, is intimately related to household structure. Poverty rates are calculated on the basis of household equivalent income the sum of the incomes of all household members, divided by a factor related to the number and ages of these same household members and household composition is therefore liable to affect both the numerator and the denominator of this calculation. There is a large literature dealing with the relationship between household composition and the risk of poverty Bane and Ellwood 1986, particularly relating to vulnerable groups: families with children Bradbury and Jantti 1999; young adults Aassve et al 2007 and older people Rendall 1995. Of course, poverty is not the only outcome related to household composition: childrens later outcomes, in terms of educational achievement, future earnings and so on, are affected by the composition of the households in which they grow up Boggess 1998; Francesconi et al. 2005, even after accounting for the effects of poverty associated with certain household structures, while older peoples health status is also related to household composition Hays 2002. Household structures across the preenlargement EU15 have been widely documented Iacovou 2003, Tomassini et al 2004, Andersson 2004, Robson and Berthoud 2003, and many others. There are also several studies which include a number of Eastern European countries Hantrais et al 2006, Hoem et al 2009, Gerber 2009. These are based on surveys such as the Family and Fertility survey and the Gender and Generations survey, which are excellent sources of data for this area of research, but which include only a limited subset of the new EU member states. A smaller number of newer studies have used data covering most or all of the countries of the enlarged European Union: Mandic 2008 deals with homeleaving, 1 Liefbroer and Fokkema 2008 deal with fertility; while Saraceno 2008 provides an overview of household structure in a number of different age groups, as well as some statistics on labour market status and time use. Our paper is based on the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions EUSILC, which at the time of writing covers all countries of the expanded European Union except for Malta. Being a generalpurpose data set, the EUSILC does not allow for such detailed investigation of family formation patterns as some other data sets. However, its strength lies in the scope of its coverage, which makes it possible to draw comparisons of many aspects of family structure, over almost the entire postenlargement European Union. We believe that this paper provides a unique resource in this respect. We present detailed figures on household structure separately for each country in the sample. However, we also consider whether there exist groups of countries which display similar sets of characteristics, and which may be thought of as forming clusters. Again, there is a welldeveloped literature in this area relating to the preenlargement EU15, and our focus in this paper lies in integrating the new member states into this area. In particular, we are interested to uncover the extent to which the new member states may be incorporated into existing typologies of family structure, or whether behaviour in some or all of these countries differs so far from behaviour elsewhere in Western Europe that it is necessary to think in terms of an expanded typology. The section which follows outlines the typologies which have been used to conceptualise crossnational variations in family structure; we then move on to a discussion of the data, before presenting our results in sections 3 to 8. 1.1 Countries and groups of countries A great deal of comparative research draws on the work of EspingAndersen 1990 and 1999, whose threefold typology of welfare states consists of: a socialdemocratic regime type, characterised by high levels of state support and an emphasis on the individual rather than the family, typified by the Scandinavian countries; a conservative, or corporatist, regime type, characterised by an emphasis on insurancebased benefits providing support for the family rather than the individual, and typified by the continental European states of France, Germany, 2 Austria, Belgium and Luxembourg. EspingAndersen also assigns the Southern European countries to this group; and a liberal regime type, typified by a modest level of welfare state provision and a reliance on meanstested benefits, exemplified by the US, and to a lesser extent by the UK and Ireland. Several commentators Liebfried, 1993; Ferrera, 1996; and others have argued that the Southern European countries constitute a regime type in themselves, rather than belonging to the conservative group. The arguments on this issue are mixed Arts and Gelissen, 2002 with several scholars arguing that structurally, the Southern welfare states are not dissimilar to those of the conservative group of countries. However, the Southern countries do form an empirically distinct grouping on a wide range of social and economic indicators, and thus are often defined separately for the purposes of empirical research. In fact, it is not clear that a typology based on welfare regimes is the most appropriate basis on which to study living arrangements and family formation. Berthoud and Iacovou 2004, in an analysis of Western European family structure, argue that a typology based on religious affiliation or geography explains family structure as well or better than one based on welfare regimes, proposing a spectrum ranging from NorthernProtestant to SouthernCatholic. At one end, the Scandinavian countries are characterised by small households particularly singleadult and loneparent households, early residential independence for young people and extended residential independence for elderly people; cohabitation as an alternative to marriage; and an almost complete absence of the extended family. At the other end, the Southern European countries are characterised by relatively low levels of nonmarital cohabitation, by extended coresidence between parents and their adult children, and by elderly people with their adult offspring; this, together with a much lower incidence of loneparent families, make for much larger household sizes. Reher 1998 outlines a typology based on geography and the familialistic legacy of the Catholic church, in explaining features of family structure across Western Europe. He describes a Northern cluster Scandinavia, the UK, the Low Countries and much of Germany and Austria, characterised by weak family ties, early homeleaving, and a sense of social rather than familial solidarity with elderly or weak members of society; and a Southern cluster the Mediterranean countries, 3 including Portugal characterised by strong family ties, later homeleaving, and a more familybased sense of solidarity. He notes that Ireland is an indeterminate case, being geographically Northern, but having much more in common with the Mediterranean countries in terms of family structures. Hajnal 1965 and 1982 describes divisions in marriage patterns along a different EastWest axis, with regions east of a line from St Petersburg to Trieste characterised by nearuniversal and relatively early marriage, and regions west of this line characterised by later marriage, with a higher proportion of individuals remaining unmarried. In this paper, we use the following fourfold grouping to present our results. The first group is a Nordic cluster consisting of the Scandinavian countries Sweden, Denmark and Finland plus the Netherlands. The second group consists of the preenlargement countries of NorthWestern Europe: the UK, France, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg and Ireland. The third group consists of the Southern European countries: Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Cyprus. The final group is an Eastern group consisting of the other post2004 members of the EU: the Czech Republic, Hungary, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia, Slovakia and Poland. Of course, not all countries fall neatly into one or other of these groups. Where there are intermediate cases, we have positioned these on the edge of a group. The Netherlands, for example, is defined by EspingAndersen 1999 as a member of the Conservative rather than the SocialDemocratic welfare regime type; empirically, it is in some respects closer to our NorthWestern cluster than the Nordic cluster, and has been placed on the boundary between the Nordic and NorthWestern groups. Ireland has been placed on the boundary between the NorthWestern group where it belongs geographically and the Southern group with which it displays a large number of common features. And Cyprus has been placed on the boundary between the Southern group with which it has clear geographical and cultural commonalities and the other new EU members. As will become clear, the Eastern European countries are very far from forming a homogeneous grouping. This group may be thought of as consisting of three subgroups: the Czech Republic and Hungary which have a good deal in common with the NorthWestern cluster; Slovenia, Slovakia and Poland which are extremely 4 similar to the Southern cluster; and the Baltic Republics Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which are in some respects most different to any of the preenlargement countries. 2. Data and methodology 2.1 Data The data used in this paper are taken from the Community Statistics on Income and Living Conditions EUSILC. The EUSILC is an annual survey which provides micro data on a wide range of social indicators including income, poverty, social exclusion and living conditions. The first release of data relating to the year 2004 includes information on 13 member states Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain and Sweden, plus Norway and Iceland. From 2005, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK joined, along with the rest of the new member states Cyprus, Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. Finally, from 2007 onwards, the EUSILC represents all 27 member states, and includes Turkey and Switzerland as nonmembers alongside Norway and Iceland. The EUSILC consists of both crosssectional and longitudinal elements. In most countries the sample design takes the form of a rotational panel: the sample is divided into subpanels, each subpanel is retained in the sample for a maximum of four years, and each year one subpanel is dropped, to be replaced by a new replication. In most countries the sample is divided into four rotational groups giving rise to fouryear panels; exceptions are France nineyear panel; Norway eightyear panel and Luxembourg and Sweden pure panels. The crosssectional and longitudinal data are released separately; data for the analysis in this paper are taken from version 20072 of the crosssectional SILC. For the purposes of the analysis in this paper, it is important to note that the data relate to private households only, and that the sample of respondents is drawn from members of these households currently resident at the time of data collection. Those living hospitals, old peoples homes and student accommodation are not included as part of the sample. In all countries, a large majority of individuals do of course live in private households, but for some groups, a substantial proportion live in institutional settings most notably older people, institutional settings in 5 students, and younger men engaged in military service. It is difficult to quantify the impact of these phenomena; Appendix 2 attempts to quantify the problem in relation to the younger groups. 2.2 Defining relationships between individuals When analysing peoples living arrangements, it is necessary to establish the relationships between members of households. Many householdlevel data sets do this by means of a household grid, which records the nature of the relationship between each pair of household members. Unfortunately, the EUSILC does not collect this type of information, recording instead only the personal identifiers of each individuals spouse or partner, mother and father, where these are resident in the same household. This enables us to identify which people are living as part of a couple, andor with their children or parents; we are also sometimes able to identify sibling and grandparent relationships, where a third person is present. However, many relationships cannot be identified for example, we are generally unable to distinguish a coresident sibling or cousin from a friend or lodger. In addition, although we are able to identify the parentchild relationship, there is a degree of uncertainty relating to the specific nature of that relationship. In particular, the role of stepparents is not always clear. It appears that the use of the mother and father identifiers has not been entirely consistent, so that in some cases they have been used exclusively to indicate natural parents, while in others they have been used to indicate stepparents as well. Given the increase in stepfamilies over recent decades, this is a particularly unfortunate limitation with the data. We return to these limitations at various points in the paper, and they should be borne in mind while interpreting our analysis. Nevertheless, the EUSILC allows a great deal of interesting analysis on household structure, and it remains a useful, and in many respects unique, source of data on this topic. 2.3 Methodology The analysis in this paper is for the most part descriptive the figures and tables in sections 36 present means over the populations of interest, and compare them between countries. All country means are weighted using the crosssectional weights supplied with EUSILC. 6 For most of the analysis, we also present the mean across the EU15 old member states, the mean across the nine new member states represented in these data; and the average across all countries in the sample. Analysts normally use one of two methods for computing these crosscountry means. One method involves calculating a simple average of the country means which gives each country, large or small, the same weight. Alternatively, countries may be weighted according their populations, so that large countries make a larger contribution to crosscountry means. We use this second method: countries are weighted according to their populations. to In this type of analysis, the issue arises of whether means which appear to be different are actually different, in a statistical sense. We have computed standard errors for all the figures we present; however, to present them systematically would run the risk of adding further complication to our already very full tables. These standard errors are sufficiently small that wherever we note systematic differences between groups of countries, these differences are statistically significant; however, smaller differences between countries in the same group may not be statistically significant. Full tables, complete with standard errors, can be found in Appendix I. The majority of the analysis presents means over individuals. In the section on older people, we present means calculated over people aged 65 and over; in the section on children, we present means calculated over people aged under 18. In each case, the population over which we have calculated the means is stated clearly in the footnotes. In some cases, for example, when dealing with concepts which relate to the household rather than to the individual, it is more appropriate to calculate means over households. Where we have done this, it is stated clearly in the text and footnotes. Finally, two sets of results in the paper use different analytical approaches. In Table 5, we present the ages at which young people make a range of life transitions moving out of the parental home, living with a partner and having children. These ages may be interpreted as representing the mean ages at which these transitions are made; however, they are calculated in a slightly different way. The way in which these calculations are made is explained in the relevant section. Section 7 7 synthesises the results from the foregoing sections using principal components analysis. Again, this technique is explained further in that section. Results are presented in the form of tables, graphs and maps. Almost all the results are based on our own analysis of the EUSILC data; we therefore do not repeat this information in the footnotes. 3. Household composition In this section, we discuss household composition at its broadest level. The first seven columns of Table 3.1 define seven categories of households, and show how the prevalence of these household types varies across the EU. The first column relates to singleadult households, where the adult is aged under 65. These make up 17.6% of households across the EU: this proportion ranges from 6% in Portugal up to 30% in Denmark, and in general is lowest in the Southern European countries, plus Slovenia, Slovakia and Poland; rather higher in the rest of Eastern Europe; higher still in the NorthWestern group of countries; and highest in the Nordic group. The distribution of coupleonly households where both adults are aged under 65 is similar column 3. These households account for 14% of households across the EU, with the prevalence ranging from only 8% in Slovenia, up to 20% in Finland. We turn now to households where at least one adult is aged 65 or over. The distribution of these household types does not follow our country groupings neatly; this is to be expected, since many factors contribute to household composition among older people: typical age differences between partners; differences in life expectancy between men and women; rates of divorce and separation; and the decision as to whether to live with adult children or other relatives. Singleadult households among the 65 age group column 2 are most common in the Nordic and NorthWestern groups of countries where divorce is relatively common and where it is relatively unusual for older people to live with children or other relatives and least common in the Southern countries where divorce rates remain low, and where it is common for older people to live with adult children. Coupleonly households where at least one partner is aged 65 or over column 4 are most common in the Southern European countries low divorce rates and least common in Eastern Europe high divorce rates, and a high incidence of multigenerational households. 8 Household composition: percentage of households Household size Children under 18 present 2 Mean over individuals Mean over households adults with children Table 3.1: Characteristics of households No children under 18 in household Single adult under 65 1 24.0 Sweden 25.6 Finland 30.2 Denmark 23.5 Netherlands 16.7 UK 20.0 France 24.4 Germany 21.7 Austria 20.6 Belgium 18.0 Luxembourg 11.3 Ireland 14.1 Italy 8.6 Spain 6.4 Portugal 10.4 Greece 8.9 Cyprus Czech Republic 12.4 Hungary 11.5 18.3 Estonia 12.8 Latvia Lithuania 12.1 9.0 Slovenia 11.4 Slovakia 11.3 Poland EU25 17.6 18.5 EU15 EU10 11.6 Single adult aged 65 2 15.6 13.0 14.0 11.7 13.6 14.2 14.0 13.4 13.5 10.9 10.1 15.0 8.7 10.6 9.7 7.2 11.4 12.8 15.4 12.4 14.9 11.8 13.1 13.4 13.2 13.3 13.0 Couple both under 65 3 16.6 19.7 16.5 17.0 16.6 15.9 14.7 12.5 15.6 13.7 9.5 8.5 12.2 9.5 8.8 9.6 14.4 12.8 11.1 8.6 9.6 7.8 8.0 10.0 13.5 14.0 10.8 Couple, at least Other, no one 65 4 11.8 10.1 9.9 11.1 10.3 11.2 14.2 10.2 10.4 10.4 7.3 11.1 10.0 12.1 12.3 11.9 10.0 8.6 7.8 6.5 7.9 8.8 7.9 6.6 11.0 11.6 7.7 under18s 5 5.7 7.6 4.4 10.0 12.8 11.0 11.5 15.8 13.4 14.9 20.5 24.2 29.2 26.5 29.9 25.3 22.2 22.6 19.1 25.7 21.9 30.8 30.1 24.6 17.0 15.8 24.3 Single adult with children 6 4.2 3.4 4.8 2.8 5.4 3.5 3.1 3.5 3.8 2.4 7.1 1.9 1.1 2.0 1.0 1.9 2.9 3.2 4.2 4.0 3.8 2.0 1.3 1.8 3.1 3.2 2.3 7 22.0 20.8 20.2 23.9 24.7 24.2 18.1 23.0 22.7 29.7 34.4 25.1 30.2 33.0 28.0 35.4 26.7 28.6 24.2 30.1 29.8 29.9 28.2 32.4 24.6 23.7 30.3 8 2.8 2.9 2.7 3.0 3.1 3.0 2.7 3.1 3.1 3.1 3.6 3.1 3.3 3.3 3.3 3.6 3.1 3.3 3.1 3.4 3.3 3.5 3.7 3.8 3.1 3.0 3.6 9 2.1 2.1 2.0 2.3 2.4 2.3 2.1 2.3 2.3 2.5 2.8 2.4 2.8 2.8 2.7 2.9 2.5 2.6 2.3 2.6 2.6 2.8 2.8 2.8 2.4 2.3 2.7 Notes: In this table, bold type denotes the eight countries with the highest incidence, and italics denote the eight countries with the lowest, incidence of each situation. Children are defined as individuals under the age of 18; the children living in the households in columns 8 and 9 are not necessarily the children of the other household members.Column 5 relates to all other households where children under 18 are not present. In all countries, the majority of these are households containing both parents and their adult children; however, in the Southern and Eastern European countries, a substantial 9 minority of households are composed differently for example, with a couple plus another adult of similar age, who may be a sibling. These households are most common in the Southern European countries plus Slovenia, Slovakia and Poland; they are less common in the NorthWestern Nordic countries, and much less common in the Nordic cluster, where they account for only 4% of households in Denmark. The remaining household types relate to households with children under 18. Those with a single adult i.e. lone parent households, column 6 are in a minority everywhere, being most common in Ireland and the UK 7% and 5% of households respectively, as well as in Sweden and Finland and the Baltic states. Lone parent households are least common in Southern Europe plus Slovenia, Slovakia and Poland. Finally, Column 7 relates to households where two or more adults are living with children. These are not necessarily twoparent families; some are oneparent families with adult children as well as minor children; or they may be extended families with children. These account for 25% of households across the EU25; while singleadult families with children are considerably more numerous in the Northern than the Southern countries, the opposite is true of families with more than one adult, which are most common in the Southern countries, plus parts of Eastern Europe, and least common in the Nordic countries. The final two columns in Table 3.1 are concerned with mean household size. Column 8 shows mean household size using the individual as the unit of analysis; Column 9 calculates the mean over households, and thus provides smaller means, because larger households are only counted once. Mean household sizes are lowest in the Scandinavian countries, and also low in the NorthWestern countries, with the exception of Ireland. The two different methods of calculating mean household sizes produce slightly different rankings for the largest household sizes. Taking the mean over households, the largest households are seen in the Southern European countries, plus Ireland, Slovenia, Slovakia and Poland. If the mean is taken over individuals, on the other hand, the Eastern European countries are those with the largest household sizes: this is because the Eastern European countries have more very large households than the Southern European countries. 10 4. Children Childrens living arrangements are of interest to social scientists because of their relationship to child poverty and to outcomes in later life. We begin this section with a short discussion of childlessness; we then present statistics on family size and childrens living arrangements.

We are not able to calculate rates of childlessness directly from the data we are using here, because while EUSILC collects information on all children living in respondents households, it does not collect information on respondents children who are no longer living in the parental home. We therefore estimate a different indicator of childlessness, using a sample of women aged between 33 and 37 years old. These women are old enough to have had most of the children they are ever going to have; and they are young enough that only a very small proportion of their children will have left home. Thus, the proportion of women in this age group who have none of their own children living with them approximates well to the proportion of this cohort who are childless. This proportion is lowest Lithuania at 7%, and generally across the Eastern European countries plus Ireland. It is highest in Italy and Spain at over 33%, as well as in a number of Nordic and Northern countries. Thus, although childlessness is increasing across the Eastern European countries Philipov and Dorbritz 2003, childlessness across this cohort has not yet risen to the levels seen elsewhere in Europe. Comparing these figures on childlessness with figures on total fertility rates column 2, there is no clear relationship between the two series. In several countries, the relationship runs along the lines which one would expect. France, Luxembourg and Ireland have low levels of childlessness and high TFRs; Italy, Spain and Germany have high levels of childlessness and low TFRs. However, across Eastern Europe, levels of childlessness are low, but total fertility rates are also low this may be attributed to postponement and possible permanent reductions in fertility among the youngest cohorts. By contrast, in a number of Nordic and Northern countries, rates of childlessness among the 3337 age group are very high, while TFRs are also relatively high though generally below replacement rate. This has to do with a the postponement of fertility being a less recent phenomenon in these countries, and b the fact that larger families are more common in these countries. The four columns on the righthand side of Table 4.1 present figures on the number of children present in households. These are calculated using the sample of 12 households where any child under 18 is present; it is important to remember a that these are means over households rather than individuals, and b that they do not include any offspring who are not currently resident in the household, or any offspring over age 18, even if they are resident in the household. Thus, these figures will tend to underestimate the proportions of larger families, particularly in those countries where homeleaving takes place earlier; however, they are indicative of crosscountry variations in family size. The very largest families are found in Ireland, where 21% of families have three or more children, and where 5% of families have four or more children. The next largest families are found in Belgium and the Netherlands, followed by the rest of the Nordic cluster. The smallest families, based on the percentage of households with three or more children, are found in Spain, Portugal, Greece and Italy in these countries, under 7% of households have three or more children. These countries, in common with a number of other Eastern European countries, also have a relatively large number of households with only one child. We turn now to a childseye view of living arrangements. Declining marriage rates, rising rates of cohabitation and high rates of union dissolution trends which have all been a feature of recent decades mean children may spend time growing up in a number of different household types e.g. lone parent households, cohabiting couple households. Table 4.2 shows the proportions of children ie, those under age 18 living in four such situations: living with one parent; with two parents who are cohabiting but not married; and two parents who are married to each other. There are also a small number of children who are not living with either natural parent; we include these in the table for completeness. Because the EUSILC data do not allow us to distinguish fully between natural parents, official stepparents, and other coresident partners, we have allocated children to these categories as follows. The one parent category includes all children living with only one parent, where that parent does not have a coresident partner. The two parents, cohabiting category includes children living with two parents who are cohabiting rather than married, as well as children living with one parent who is cohabiting with a partner who is not defined as the childs parent. The two parents, married category includes children living with two parents who are 13 married, as well as children living with one parent who is married to an adult who is not defined as the childs parent. Despite these limitations, our findings are similar to those of eg PerelliHarris et al 2009, who cover fewer countries with better data.

Bold type denotes the eight countries with the highest incidence, and italics denote the eight countries with the lowest, incidence of each situation. Starting with the lefthand column of Table 4.2, we observe that very few children in any country live with adults who are not recorded as their parents the figures range from 0.3% in Luxembourg and the Netherlands to 3.3% in Latvia. Table 4.2 is based on a sample of all under18s, and some of those recorded as living with no natural 14 parents will be teenagers who have moved out of their parents home. These account for about one quarter of those recorded in this column. The second column of Table 4.2 presents the percentage of children living with a lone parent. This percentage ranges from 7% or less in Greece, Spain and Cyprus, up to 24% in Ireland and 27% in Latvia. As we have seen before, there is a high degree of heterogeneity within the Eastern European group: in the Baltic republics, the rates of lone parenthood are among the highest in Europe, while in Slovenia, Slovakia and Poland, they are among the lowest. These figures may usefully be compared with the figures on lone parent households in Table 1.1: in general, those countries with a large proportion of lone parent households are the same countries with a large proportion of children living with a lone parent, and vice versa. Looking at the percentage of children living with two parents in a cohabiting union column 3, this follows a broadly similar pattern, with high proportions of cohabiting partnerships in the Nordic countries and the Baltic republics, and low proportions in the Southern European countries plus Slovakia and Poland. Finally, we look at the percentage of children living with two parents who are married. Over 90% of children in Greece and Cyprus live with two married parents; the proportions are also high across the rest of Southern Europe and in Slovakia and Poland. By contrast, only half of all children live with two married parents in Sweden, largely thanks to the high proportion whose parents are cohabiting rather than married; this is also the case in Estonia and Latvia, where high rates of lone parenthood also play a role. The final column of Table 4.2 shows the percentages of children who live in multi generational households defined here as households where grandparents as well as parents are present. There is a clear regional gradient here. Well under 1% of children in the Nordic cluster live in multigenerational households; 15% of children live in multigenerational households in all other NorthWestern countries except for Austria where the figure is higher; and around 6% of children live in multigenerational households in Southern European countries except in Portugal, where the figure is 11.6%. However, in Eastern Europe, the figures are much higher: over 10% of children live in multigenerational households in all countries except the Czech Republic, and this rises to over 20% in Poland and Latvia. 15 5. Young adults The transition from childhood to adulthood is characterised by a number of transitions: from the parental home to living independently; from the single state to living with a partner; and from childlessness to parenthood. Not all young people make all these transitions, and some never make any; however, the majority do make some of these transitions in their twenties or thirties. These transitions have a direct relationship with young peoples wellbeing and life chances: making these transitions at an early age is associated with early independence, but may also particularly in the case of early homeleaving or early childbearing be associated with an increased risk of poverty and disadvantage Aassve et al. 2007. By contrast, the very late transitions observed in the Southern European countries, while being protective against poverty, may delay independence and may also be burdensome for the parents of young people Schizzerotto and Gasperoni 2001. Because some of these transitions are reversible young people may leave home and move back in again, or they may live with a partner for a short time before subsequently splitting up, it is difficult to calculate the mean or median ages at which these transitions are made by observing the transitions themselves. Instead taking homeleaving as an example, we assume that young people who are currently observed living with their parents have not made the transition out of the parental home, and we assume that those currently observed as living independently have made the transition. Of course, we will count some young people who have left home and come back again as not having yet made the transition; and we will count some people who are living away from home but for whom the transition is not permanent as having made the transition. But these errors are likely to cancel each other out. We then use nonparametric regression techniques to calculate the age at which 50% of all young people are observed living away from home, or living with a partner or with children, and consider this analogous to the median age of making the transitions. Before discussing these figures further, it is worth pointing out that they are based only on young people living in private households those living in institutional settings such as military barracks or university residences will not be sampled. We believe our results are reasonably robust to these issues: see Appendix 2. 16 The results of these calculations are shown in the first six columns of Table 5.1. Results are shown for men and women separately, because women tend to make all these transitions at an earlier age than men. The first two columns show the age by which half of all young people have left the parental home. There is a strong divide here between the regional groupings we have defined: for both men and women, the countries where the transition takes place earliest are those of the Nordic cluster; the remainder are in the NorthWestern group of countries. The transition takes place latest in the Southern European countries, plus three of the Eastern European countries: Slovenia, Slovakia and Poland; homeleaving is also relatively late elsewhere in Eastern Europe. The range is very large indeed: 50% of women have left home by age 20 in Finland and Denmark, while the corresponding age in many Southern European countries is 27 or 28. The next two columns show the age by which 50% of young people are living with a partner. The regional patterns are essentially the same as those for homeleaving, with partnering taking place relatively early in the Nordic and NorthWestern countries, and relatively late across Southern and Eastern Europe. However, the differences are not so stark in terms of the ages at which the transitions are made. In the Nordic countries, the median age at partnering is several years higher than the median age at leaving home, indicating that a prolonged period of living alone is the norm in these countries; while in the Southern and Eastern European countries, the mean ages at leaving home and partnering are much closer together, typically around only one year apart. In the case of Poland and Slovakia, partnership on average occurs earlier than homeleaving, indicating that it is common for young adults to remain living with their parents while they also live with a partner. Finally, we look at the age at which young people live with their own children columns 5 and 6 of Table 5.1. For women, this approximates well to the median age at first birth; for men, the approximation is less good, because some men father children they do not live with. Here, the pattern of crossnational variation is different, with the earliest childbearing evident in Cyprus plus the Eastern European countries; childbearing is relatively late in the Nordic cluster plus some of the NorthWestern countries, but latest of all in Italy and Spain, where the median age for a first birth calculated in this way is 32 for women and 36.5 and 35.5 respectively for men. 17 Table 5.1: Young people: transitions, and percentages living alone Sweden Finland Denmark Netherlands UK France Germany Austria Belgium Luxembourg Ireland Italy Spain Portugal Greece Cyprus Czech Republic Hungary Estonia Latvia Lithuania Slovenia Slovakia Poland EU25 EU15 EU10 Age by which 50% of young people are living: Away from With a partner With a child parental home Men Women Men Women Men Women 20.9 20.3 21.4 19.8 20.6 19.8 24.1 24.1 24.0 22.0 23.5 22.1 25.0 22.3 26.1 23.7 24.4 23.3 26.2 24.2 26.5 24.1 30.1 28.0 28.5 27.0 29.1 27.4 31.8 27.4 28.3 25.3 27.7 25.1 27.6 25.0 25.1 23.0 27.7 25.4 27.2 24.8 30.8 28.0 30.3 27.8 29.1 26.3 31.8 29.1 34.3 30.1 34.4 29.9 33.1 30.8 34.6 29.6 32.0 28.4 34.2 30.9 33.6 29.1 34.2 29.1 32.8 29.0 32.9 28.0 36.5 32.0 35.5 32.0 32.0 29.1 35.6 30.5 31.4 27.7 31.8 27.9 31.2 27.9 31.0 26.1 29.1 25.1 29.8 25.9 33.2 28.9 31.8 28.8 30.8 27.2 27.3 23.9 24.8 21.9 26.5 24.1 28.0 25.4 27.1 24.5 26.8 24.6 27.5 25.5 29.7 26.3 27.3 25.1 28.8 26.1 29.8 28.4 33.1 29.4 31.1 27.9 29.9 27.9 33.6 28.7 29.1 25.8 28.9 25.9 28.4 26.0 26.9 24.6 27.9 25.9 27.7 26.4 31.2 28.4 30.0 27.7 28.5 25.7 % of people aged 1828 who live alone Men Women 33.1 23.4 23.1 21.9 37.2 31.5 16.5 19.5 6.5 4.6 17.0 14.9 9.4 17.0 12.3 10.0 12.1 7.4 6.7 7.8 2.4 3.0 3.9 4.2 1.6 3.5 2.5 1.5 9.0 8.4 2.9 2.9 3.1 4.8 3.3 3.9 11.4 8.0 1.5 1.8 3.6 3.6 1.5 1.6 0.8 2.0 2.5 3.3 8.6 9.0 10.0 10.3 3.0 3.2 Note: Bold type denotes the eight highest numbers, and italic type denotes the eight lowest numbers, in each column. The last two columns in Table 5.1 indicate the percentage of men and women aged between 18 and 28 who live alone in each country. These figures range from only a few percentage points in Slovenia, Slovakia and Poland, to over 20% in the Scandinavian countries, and over 30% for both sexes in Denmark. This reflects the difference in the median ages of leaving home and living with a partner which we mentioned before: where the gap between these two ages is small, the percentage 18 of young people living alone is also small, and where the gap between the two ages is large, this is reflected in a high proportion of young people living alone. 6. Partnerships: cohabitation and marriage One area in which there are substantial differences between Northern and Southern European countries is in the prevalence of cohabitation as a substitute for marriage Kiernan 1999: nonmarital cohabitation is far more common in Northern than in Southern European countries, particularly in the Nordic countries, where it is very much the norm among childless young people. Table 6.1 shows the percentage of oppositesex partnerships which are reported as cohabiting rather than marital partnerships in each country, for four age groups: couples where the woman is in her twenties, her thirties, her forties and her fifties. For each age group, two sets of figures are reported: the first for partnerships where there are no coresident children, and the second for partnerships where the children of one or both partners are resident in the household. It should be noted that this is not a perfect indicator of couples who have children many couples in their fifties, and some in their forties, will have children who have moved away from the parental home, and will thus not be counted as having children in the data. It is clear that there is a substantial age gradient in all countries, with couples in their twenties substantially more likely to be cohabiting than couples in their forties and fifties. These figures do not allow us to separate out age effects sample members in their twenties have not got married yet, but many will from cohort effects people born in the 1980s are less likely to get married, ever, than people born in the 1950s. However, some combination of these two effects is leading to a strong gradient: across the EU as a whole, 63% of childless partnerships among people in their twenties are cohabiting, compared with just 8% of childless partnerships among those in their fifties; for partnerships where children are present, the corresponding figures are 28% for those in their twenties, against 3% for those in their fifties. A steep northsouth gradient is also evident from Table 6.1. In the Nordic countries, well over half of all childless couples in their twenties and thirties are cohabiting; in the other Northern European countries, the proportion cohabiting is lower, but still high, while it is much lower in Southern Europe ranging from 7% of childless couples in their thirties in Greece to 29% in Portugal. Levels of nonmarital cohabitation in the Eastern 19 European countries are rather heterogeneous, being as low as Southern European levels in Poland, Slovakia and Lithuania, and comparable with Nordic levels in Estonia.

Bold type denotes the eight highest numbers, and italic type denotes the eight lowest numbers, in each column. There are also strong differences between couples with and without children: in all countries, for all age groups, couples with children are less likely to cohabit than couples without children, and in nearly all cases these differences are large. However, 20 in some countries these differences are systematically larger than in others. Figure 6.1 shows the percentage of cohabiting unions by age group for Sweden and the Netherlands. For childless couples, the percentage in cohabiting unions is somewhat higher in Sweden than in the Netherlands, but the numbers are not hugely dissimilar: 91% against 86% for those in their twenties, and 45% versus 38% for those in their forties. However, when we turn to look at couples with children, much larger differences emerge: for those their twenties with children, 69% of Swedish couples are cohabiting, compared with only 35% in the Netherlands; for people in their forties, the figures are 29% versus 9%.

The difference does tend to be smaller where cohabitation rates are higher Sweden, Denmark, Estonia and Slovenia but the difference is large in the Netherlands, Germany and Austria where cohabitation rates are high and also in Cyprus, Greece and Slovakia where cohabitation rates are low. 7. Older people Increasing life expectancy and declining fertility mean that the elderly are set to form a progressively larger proportion of our population over future decades. Older peoples living arrangements are of key interest to policymakers: as well as being a key determinant of older peoples wellbeing, living arrangements are related to levels of social expenditure on elderly people. Table 7.1 shows the proportion of older people living in four situations: alone; without a partner but with other people; with just a spouse or partner; and with a spouse or 21 partner plus other people. Before commenting on the table, it is worth noting that these figures relate to older people in private households: older people in institutions such as nursing homes are not sampled by the EUSILC and are not included in this analysis.

As we mentioned in Section 1, the proportion of older people who are living with and without a partner is also related to the prevalence of divorce and separation in each country. Two ideal types are visible. In the Scandinavian countries plus many Northern European countries, in particular Germany and France, the predominant living arrangement for older people is either with a spouse or partner, or alone. Typically, living in a household with anyone except a spouse or partner accounts for only 10% or less of older people. In the Southern European countries, by contrast, it is much more common for older people to live with people other than a partner: in Spain, 42% of older women and 40% of older men live with others. This type of living arrangement is also relatively common in the new member states, particularly Latvia, Slovenia and Poland. Using EUSILC data it is not possible to determine the relationships of older people with the others with whom they live in every case. However, in every country, the large majority of older people who are observed living with people other than a spouse or partner, are observed living with at least one of their adult children. These are generally not the same households which form the group considered in section 5, of young adults living with their parents; in most cases, the parents in these households would be too young to be included in the analysis in this section. The relationship between these groups is worthy of further analysis. In one sense, the groups are clearly related, in that they are both composed of adults in the same household as their parents; moreover, they both tend to be found in the same groups of countries. However, there is a conceptual difference between the two household types. In the case of adult children living with their parents, it is the parental generation who may be thought of as providing support for their children; in the case of elderly people living with their adult children, the locus of support may often be the other way round, with the younger generation providing not only the majority of the income, but also an element of care for the parents. 23 8. Synthesising the differences: Factor analysis From the figures in the preceding sections, a number of patterns have emerged. One way in which these may be synthesised is via the use of factor analysis. Principal components analysis identifies three main factors, which together explain 83% of the variation between countries in the factors explored. Factor loadings are given in Table 8.1, with the most important loadings being highlighted via shaded cells. We identify the first factor as being related to the importance of the extended family: the variables contributing positively to this factor are young adults living at home; older people coresident with their own children, household size, and multigenerational households. Negatively related to this first factor are young adults living alone and primeaged people living alone.

The only variables which are related to this factor are babies living with a lone parent; children living with a lone parent; primeaged people who are divorced or separated and not living with another partner and old people living alone. This variable does appear to be related to the stability of the intimate relationship rather than to notions of social liberalism, 24 since cohabitation as an alternative to marriage makes no contribution to this factor at all. The third factor relates to fertility, with childless women making a negative contribution, and the number of children per woman making a positive contribution. Factors 1 and 2 are plotted on Figure 8.1. Six clusters of countries have been identified. Clearly, there is no unique way of identifying these clusters clusters towards the centre of the graph could be combined, as could the two clusters in the southeast of the graph. First, we note that the old EU15 form the clusters which might have been expected based on previous research. The socialdemocratic countries including the Netherlands form one group, scoring low on both the extended family and the relationship instability axis. The Southern European countries score high on the extended family axis and low on the relationship instability axis, while the remaining countries of NorthWestern Europe occupy an intermediate position on the extended family axis, and score generally higher on the relationship instability axis. Ireland occupies a position slightly apart from this group, scoring almost as high on the extended family axis as the Southern European countries, and also very high on the relationship instability axis. The new member states are rather heterogeneous. Cyprus falls very close to the other Southern European countries, which is to be expected given commonalities of geography, language and culture. Three of the Eastern European countries display similar, but more extreme, characteristics to the Southern European group, scoring even higher on the extended family axis and at similar very low levels on the relationship stability axis. These countries are Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia, all of which have maintained a Catholic tradition through the Communist years see Table 10.1 in Appendix 2. The remaining countries include the three Baltic states Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia and the Czech Republic and Hungary. All these countries occupy a more northeasterly position on the graph than the other countries, scoring high on both the extended family and the relationship instability axes. Ireland previously an outlier in relation to the other NorthWestern countries occupies a position close to the Czech Republic and Hungary. 25 Figure 8.1: Clusters arising from Principal Components Analysis These results are fairly robust to the particular variables included in the analysis. In particular, we experimented with different formulations of the variables indicating divorce, since it was unexpected to us at least that the Scandinavian countries, which score rather low on the relationship instability axis, while they have some of the highest divorce rates in the world. In fact, it appears that this factor does not relate to divorce per se, but rather to the proportion of people living alone following divorce or separation and similarly, to the proportion of children living with an unpartnered parent following divorce or separation. It seems that the Scandinavian countries, while having high divorce rates, also have relatively high rates of subsequent repartnering, and thus have a much lower proportion of divorced or separated adults still living alone. We also explored the phenomenon of cohabitation in some detail; we had been expecting this analysis to generate a factor indicating social liberalism, which would be explained by cohabitation as well as by divorce and lone parenthood. However, we were unable to formulate any indicator of cohabitation which contributed significantly to any such factor; the second factor remained 26 stubbornly as an indicator of partnership breakdown without subsequent repartnering. 9. Conclusions In this paper, we have mapped a range of indicators of household structure across the expanded European Union. One of our main aims has been to focus particularly on the newer member states of the EU, and to assess the extent to which household structures in these countries display similarities and differences to household structures in the old EU15. Of the new member states, we find that Cyprus is extremely similar to the Southern European countries, as might be expected with reference to cultural, geographic and religious factors. We also find that there is a great deal of heterogeneity among the Eastern European countries. One group of countries Slovenia, Slovakia and Poland are consistently very similar to the Southern European countries. In these three countries, the extended family is the norm: young adults leave home late, older people often live with their adult children, threegenerational households are common, and loneparent families are relatively uncommon. In terms of mapping onto a geographicalreligious spectrum, Slovenia is the only one of these countries which is geographically Southern, but all three of these countries remain strongly Catholic or Orthodox. The Czech Republic and Hungary, by contrast, have more in common with the countries of the NorthWestern cluster. On a large number of indicators, these countries occupy an intermediate position between the Nordic cluster on the one hand, and the SouthernCatholic cluster on the other; and in the factor analysis, they occupy a position close to the other countries of the NorthWestern cluster particularly Ireland. Of the Eastern European countries, it is in the Baltic countries where family patterns diverge most widely from the geographicalreligious spectrum. These countries display a number of features in common with the Southern European countries; chiefly, a large number of large and multigenerational households. However, they also display a number of striking dissimilarities with the Southern European countries, particularly in terms of the very large numbers of loneparent families, and other singleadult households. In many respects, the Baltic states are very 27 heterogeneous: for example, nonmarital cohabitation is much more common in Estonia, and very much less common in Lithuania; while lone parenthood and multigenerational households are more common in Latvia than in the other two Baltic states. In this paper we have answered a number of questions, but these in turn raise further questions. One question, which we raised in Section 6, relates to the nature of multigenerational households. We have shown that, in a swathe of countries across Southern and much of Eastern Europe, coresidence between generations is very common, particularly so in contrast to the Nordic group of countries, where it is extremely unusual. We have shown that this coresidence is manifested both by young adults remaining in the parental household, but also by older people living with their adult children. The question which this raises, and which in this analysis we have not yet been able to answer, is whether the second household type is merely a persistent form of the first ie, that the young adults whom we see living with their parents become the same primeage adults who live with their elderly parents or whether the two household types are in fact drawn from different social groups. Two other questions also arise relating to multigenerational households. The first is the extent to which they arise as a result of social and cultural preferences people actually like living with other family members, and make a positive choice to do this as opposed to arising as a result of economic constraints young people who would like to leave the parental home but cannot afford to; or older people who cannot afford to live alone. There is limited evidence to suggest that in Southern European countries, at least part of young peoples extended residence in the parental home arises from preferences Manacorda and Moretti 2006. However, this has not been systematically addressed for other age groups, or across the new member states. Another question which we might pose in relation to multigenerational households is the degree to which individuals are supporting each other, both economically and in other ways, by living together. The assumption tends to be that when young adults are living with their parents, it is the parents who are supporting the young adults; while when very elderly individuals are living with their adult offspring, it is the elderly people who are receiving that support. However, this too has not been systematically tested, particularly in the context of the expanded European Union. 28 Finally, the picture we have presented has been essentially static: we have not addressed the important issue of how household structures are evolving Billari et al 2002. We are unable to answer this question definitively with the crosssectional data we have at our disposal; however, we may make inferences based on evidence drawn from elsewhere. As far as attitudes are concerned, there is some evidence that these are converging across Europe, with smaller betweencountry differences among younger people than their parents. Rosina and Fabroni 2004 find that although marriage remains the predominant route out of the parental home in Italy, cohabitation is becoming more prevalent and is set to increase further. Billari 2005 investigates trends in a range of indicators, concluding that there is limited evidence of general convergence in attitudes and behaviours, but that on a number of indicators, convergence is apparent. A further clue towards the evolution of living patterns lies in the fact that incomes in the new Eastern European member states are growing faster than those in the old EU15 Van Kerm, 2009. To the extent that behaviour is driven by economic factors for example, to the extent that intergenerational coresidence is driven by economic constraints this suggests that again, we may observe a degree of convergence in living arrangements between the countries of the expanded European Union. 29 10.

Appendix II In this appendix, we present figures which do not relate directly to the analysis in the paper, but which are useful for its interpretation.

While institutional accommodation are unlikely to be reported as living at a private address in a survey such as EUSILC, it is likely that some younger people temporarily living away for reasons of study or military service might be reported by their families as still living in the household, particularly if they still return home frequently. that older people living in it is likely First, we consider military service. As shown in Table 12.1, eight of the countries require young men to engage in national service; typically, this becomes an obligation on leaving secondary education aged 18 or 19, although in most cases it 41 may be deferred for reasons including study or family obligations. Because conscription only affects young men in some countries women are allowed to register for national service, but in these cases women volunteer only in small numbers, then if young men engaged in military service are systematically missing from the survey, we should observe a substantial difference in the numbers of men and women in the survey at the ages when young men are most likely to be engaged in military service. Figure 12.1 takes as a sample all people aged between 16 and 26 and plots the unweighted age distribution within this group for men and women separately. The thick grey lines on the chart plots the distribution for the countries where conscription takes place excluding Sweden, where only a minority of men are conscripted. The black line plots the distribution for all other countries. If young men engaged in national service were systematically missing from the sample, we would observe a much smaller percentage of men over the age range concerned 18 to 19 years in the relevant countries. In fact, there is no evidence of this: men are very slightly underrepresented at ages 17 and 18, but they are slightly overrepresented at age 19. We have repeated this exercise for all countries where conscription occurs, and there is no evidence that young men are systematically missing from the household grid at these ages. It is possible that it is more difficult to interview young men engaged in national service, but it appears that they are being reported by their families as living at home. Figure 12.1: the age distribution of the EUSILC sample. We repeat the exercise to assess the degree to which students are missing from the EUSILC data, plotting four countries: Italy, where homeleaving is late and where it is unusual for students to live in college accommodation; and France, the UK and Denmark, where homeleaving is earlier and where stays in college accommodation are more common Figure 12.2. In countries where stays in university residential accommodation are the norm, they tend to be most common between ages 18 and 20, and are progressively less common up to the midtwenties. Thus, if the problem were that young people living at private addresses had a high probability of being 42 sampled, while young people at institutional addresses had a very low probability of being sampled, we would expect the graphs to dip steeply at ages 18 to 20, and to rise thereafter. In fact, in Denmark we observe a steep decline in the graph between ages 17 and 23, with no subsequent rise. In the UK, we observe a more moderate decline after age 17, and only a very modest rise towards the midtwenties. This suggests that there is an issue with younger people being undersampled, but that this issue arises only partly because of stays in institutional accommodation, and that a factor at least equally important is that young people living in their own private households are less likely to participate in surveys than their parents generation.
