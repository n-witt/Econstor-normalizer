This function of business associations may become still more important in transition economies, where old mechanisms for coordinating enterprise activities have been destroyed, while the new ones have not been established yet. In this context, Russian experience is a matter of interest, because for a long time, Russia was regarded as a striking example of state failures and market failures. Consequently, the key point of our study was a description of the role and place of business associations in the presentday Russian economy and their interaction with member companies and bodies of state administration. Relying on the survey data of 957 manufacturing firms conducted in 2009, we found that business associations are more frequently joined by larger companies, firms located in regional capital cities, and firms active in investment and innovation. By contrast, business associations tend to be less frequently joined by business groups subsidiaries and firms that were nonresponsive about their respective ownership structures. Our regression analysis has also confirmed that business associations are a component of what Frye 2002 calls an elite exchange although only on regional and local levels. These exchanges imply that members of business associations, on the one hand, more actively assist regional and local authorities in social development of their regions, and on the other hand more often receive support from authorities. However, this effect is insignificant in terms of support from the federal government. In general, our results allow us to believe that at present, business associations especially the industrywide and leading ones consolidate the most active, advanced companies and act as collective representatives of their interests. For this reason, business associations can be regarded as interface units between the authorities and businesses and as a possible instrument for promotion of economic development.

This function of business associations may become still more important in transition economies, where old mechanisms for coordination of enterprise activities have been destroyed, but the new ones have not been established yet Recanatini Ryterman, 2001. In this context, Russian experience is a matter of interest, because Russia was regarded for a long time as a striking example of state failures and market failures Stiglitz, 1999. Consequently, the key point of our study was a description of the role and place of business associations in the presentday Russian economy and their interaction with member companies and bodies of state administration. Within the framework of this general objective, we set a number of specific goals. First, we wanted to estimate the scale of enterprise membership in business associations in Russia. Such estimates were made in some previous empirical studies, but practically all of them were based on the data of the early and mid2000s. However, we wanted to understand how these quantitative parameters had changed after the Yukos case which made a strong impact on relations between business and government, and how they were affected by the economic crisis of 20082009. Second, we wanted to understand what factors influence membership in associations. Here, we mean objective circumstances, such as size of a firm, its ownership form, the period of its establishment, its belonging to a holding group and firms location, and characteristics of its behavior, including its activities in exports, capital investment and innovations. Third, we gave special attention to the set of relations of enterprises with administration at the federal, regional and local levels and to the role of business associations in this field. We considered not only different types of support that the firms receive from government but also counter flows of social development aid in the regions that the firms give to local and regional authorities. To achieve of these three goals, we relied on the survey data of 957 manufacturing firms, conducted in 2009 by the Institute for Industrial and Market Studies of the Higher School of Economics on order of the Ministry of Economic Development. Subsequent 3 This paper is based on the results of a research project carried out at the HSE Institute for Industrial and Market Studies and supported by the Program of fundamental studies of Higher School of Economics and research grant of Moscow Public Science Foundation.

IWH Discussion Papers 162011 5IWH __________________________________________________________________ ly, in the spring of 2010, we undertook a series of indepth qualitative interviews with heads of business associations of various types. An analysis of the collected data revealed that the proportion of business association members is close to 40% in manufacturing, while over a half of member firms perceive their business association membership to be useful. Regression analysis suggests that business associations are more frequently joined by larger companies, firms located in regional capital cities, and firms active in investment and innovation. By contrast, business associations tend to be less frequently joined by business groups subsidiaries and firms that were nonresponsive about their respective ownership structures. Business associations are a link in the framework of governmentbusiness exchanges, primarily at the regional and local levels. Indeed, business association members are more active in assisting regional and local authorities in the social development of their regions and, at the same time, receive government support more frequently. However, firm participation in business associations proved insignificant for federal support. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the existing literature on the role of business associations in economic development. Section 3 briefly describes recent developments and key trends in the sector of business associations in Russia, while Section 4 reviews earlier empirical research in this area. Section 5 presents data sources used in our analysis. Section 6 evaluates the rates of firm participation in business associations and describes member firms characteristics. Section 7 puts forth key hypotheses and explains the methodology of econometric analysis, while Section 8 presents the results. Finally, Section 9 sums up the key conclusions of the study. 2 Business Associations Impact on Economic Development: Review of Previous Studies It may be noteworthy that for many years, research literature in this area has been dominated by negative presumptions against business associations, following the wellknown books by Mancur Olson Olson, 1965 1982. This skepticism was based on Olsons argument that businessmen collectively pursue their private special interests and cannot create public goods, and interest groups entrenched in national economies give rise to institutional sclerosis, detrimental to economic performance and growth.4 These assumptions are in many respects supported by numerous further studies. A review of approximately 50 empirical studies published during the 25 years following the publication of The Rise and Decline of Nations is provided in Heckelman 2007. 4 Institutional sclerosis is the term used in literature to describe situations in which entrenched interest groups and institutions representing them block entry of new players and resist structural change, for example. 6IWH Discussion Papers 162011 __________________________________________________________________ IWH However, there are differences observed in business associations impact in countries of varying levels of development. Indeed, an empirical analysis in Coates and Heckelman 2003 demonstrates that in OECD countries, the interest group activity measured by the number of business associations included in the World Guide to Trade Associations has adverse implications for investment. Alternatively, in nonOECD countries, this correlation is positive, albeit with low significance.5 These conclusions are consistent with the findings of some qualitative studies. Drawing on a series of case studies in emerging economies, Doner and Schneider 2000 show that in an environment of imperfect government institutions, business associations may serve the government as a feedback mechanism in its interaction with business, and as a source of information about property rights violations and business barriers. In this case, Doner and Schneider define an association as a marketsupporting institution. Moreover, business associations may produce public goods when the economy lacks a developed market infrastructure. In this case, business associations may collect and share with government authorities and economic agents specific market information, ensure interfirm coordination in the development and maintenance of sector standards, and facilitate local firm entry to new markets including external markets and implementation of new technologies. In this context, the association may be viewed as a marketsupplementing institution. However, by no means can all business associations perform these functions: only those compliant with certain requirements can. Specifically, Doner and Schneider note that effective business associations performing public utility functions tend to appear in sectors where firms are exposed to stronger competitive pressures primarily, external, driving them to collective action. They should also have adequate institutional strength, based on high member density in the sector, effective mediation of member interests and skilled, competent staff members. However, the institutional strength of existing associations largely depends on selective incentives that such associations may provide to their members, due to certain powers delegated to them by the government. Such selective benefits may include access via the association to international trade negotiations, influence on legal regulations and setting sector standards, distribution of export quotas, export licenses, government contracts and training programs. Constraints on economic growth in developing countries traditionally include strong distrust of firms in each other and in government policies. This distrust results in higher risks of new business projects and weaker investment activity of firms. However, as Richard Locke demonstrated by cases from Brazil and southern Italy Locke, 2001, even against the backdrop of highly imperfect markets and government institutions including rampant corruption and rentseeking, business associations may evolve as mechanisms of coordination, facilitating mutual understanding between firms and the government, 5 Different effects produced by business association activities in advanced and developing economies were also noted in a more recent study by Coates, Heckelman, Wilson 2010. IWH Discussion Papers 162011 7IWH __________________________________________________________________ building trust and boosting economic development. In general, studies of new industrial policy Rodrik, 2004 and 2008; Hausmann et al., 2008 especially underscore the need for cooperation of business with government for elimination of market failures in transitional economies. It is of note that a number of advanced economies have shown in recent years that business associations may emerge as agents that create not only private and club goods but also public goods. Australia, for example, has been widely practicing Industry Action Agendas since the early 2000s. Industry Action Agendas are implemented under the auspices of relevant sector ministries with wide the participation of sector business associations.6 A review of outcomes produced by using these new approaches to Australias pharmaceutical industry relations is provided in Morgan et al 2008. 3 Institutional Context: Main Trends in Business Associations Development in Russia Membership is voluntary in Russian business associations. The framework of business associations was built in several stages. Business associations were initially developed when the central planning system collapsed in the late 1980s. In the context of increasingly tighter resources and overall economic destabilization, directors clubs developed into places for enterprise heads to exchange information and independently find suppliers and buyers. In 1990, the government attempted to take control of this spontaneous process of cooperation, establishing the Science and Industry Union of the USSR subsequently renamed the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs RSPP, the Association of Young Enterprise Leaders and some others. As the centrally planned economy was dismantled in 1992, exsector ministries were used as foundations to build business associations. For example, in 1992, an International Union of Steelworkers was established, with the last metallurgy minister of the USSR Sergey Kolpakov as its head. It is noteworthy that associations came to life not only for sectors but also for regions. In the latter case, they were intended to support contact and interaction with regional and local authorities. Some associations were specifically established to pursue political agendas. An example of this kind of association is the AllRussian Association of Privatized and Private Enterprises, set up in 1993 by party activists of the Democratic Choice of Russia. The Russian Chamber of Commerce and Industry TPP has played a special role in the framework of business associations and its regional affiliates. The TPP case is excep 6 For example, see http:www.daff.gov.aufisheriesaquacultureagenda which describes the process and outcomes of the Fishing Industry Action Agenda implementation in 19992005; and http: www.wfa.org.auWRAA.aspx regarding the new Wine Restructuring Action Agenda announced by the government and two leading business associations in the winemaking sector in 2009. 8IWH Discussion Papers 162011 __________________________________________________________________ IWH tional because TPP has a special legal status, according to the Law on the Chambers of 1993, and a kind of monopolistic entitlement to render certain services to enterprises, related to certification of goods for exports and imports. Many regional TPP branches established in the Soviet era have inherited assets. This made the chambers financially independent and ensured their autonomy from their members. Overall, Russian business associations in the 1990s were weakly organized and highly politicized. Meanwhile, the real influence of business groups on economic policymaking was weak, as larger enterprises preferred dealing directly with the government. This phenomenon was described in the literature as state capture Hellman et al., 2000. The situation changed after 2000 for more detail, see Zudin 2001, 2006. As Putins government tried to distance itself from personal relationships with top business leaders in place since the 1990s, they focused their attention on arranging standing consultations with business communities through top business associations. To this end, the presidential administration initiated a reorganization of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. The earlier broadbased and loose Board dominated by oldtime industrial directors red directors was replaced, with a Board Bureau as its central executive body. Owners of larger private business groups were invited to join the Board Bureau. In this way, the new RSPP was set up as a big business lobby. At the same time, OPORA Rossii and Delovay Rossia were established to lobby the interests of small and mediumsized businesses, respectively. The Russian Chamber of Commerce and Industry also shored up its position, as former Prime Minister Evgeny Primakov became its president. A specific feature of peak business associations is their closer proximity to authority, which is a distinctly important resource for efficient lobbying for members interests. These peak associations usually include the largest or the most active enterprises, but in general, they are organized as unions of unions and include industrywide associations and regional branches in their membership. In 20002003, the top associations were included in deliberations on key economic policy issues, including tax reform, WTO accession and electricity sector reform. It should be noted that RSPP, as the big business lobby, was more visible and audible in this governmentbusiness dialogue. However, the Yukos case in 20032004 resulted in a heavy crisis in governmentbusiness relations importantly, Yukos former president Mikhail Khodorkovsky had been a member of the RSPP Board Bureau since 2000, actively participating in discussions with government officials. The government stopped perceiving big business as an equal partner to be consulted on key economic policy decisions. At the same time, the Yukos case, being a striking example of selective discriminatory law enforcement, aggravated business distrust in government for more details, see Yakovlev 2006. IWH Discussion Papers 162011 9IWH __________________________________________________________________ Consequently, since the mid2000s, governmentbusiness consultation has degraded in level but expanded in coverage, with a network of civil society and expert councils established under the federal agencies in 2005 and expanded contact with sectorspecific associations initiated by some ministries. In particular, analysis of membership in nongovernment, advisory and expert councils of economic profile, created under the Presidential Administration of Russia, the Federal Government, ministries and agencies in the last decade, demonstrates the following pattern. Spokesmen of business were present in 115 out of 135 such associations, and in 96 cases 71% of all councils, they came from business associations. The leading associations more often take part in the work of deliberative bodies under the Government and federal ministries, while industrylevel associations work in councils under federal services and agencies. Therefore, Russia has developed a twotiered structure of business associations. The first, the upper tier, allowing interaction with top officials, included four top peak associations by the end of the 2000s: RSPP, TPP, OPORA and Delovaya Rossia. The second tier includes numerous sectorspecific and regionspecific associations. Absent any regulation of the activities of business associations in Russia except for the TPP law, it is difficult to offer any quantitative assessment of the size of the business associations sector. Some experts estimate that Russia has about 5,000 such associations. However, the number of operational associations is apparently smaller. In our view, the number of collective members of the top associations may be used as a proxy for the number of actual operating sectoral and regional associations. Indeed, as indicated earlier, the top associations are built as unions of unions, and members have to regularly pay their membership fees. For example, the RSPP membership fee for rankandfile members is 150,000 rubles, or approximately US 5,000. Furthermore, unlike in the 1990s, associations now monitor and enforce timely payment of fees. Therefore, these costs would be justified only for those organizations that engage in their own core operations and receive meaningful benefits from their membership in top associations. An analysis of the collective membership data of the top three associations RSPP, TPP and OPORA, available via the Internet, shows that they include approximately 300 sectorspecific and regional business associations. However, this figure may rather indicate the lower boundary of the number of active associations because, judging by our interviews, some smaller regional or sectoral associations with budgets of 1.52 million rubles a year may perceive these costs as unreasonable. Another source of quantitative assessments may be seen in the data produced by the survey of 957 manufacturing firms administered by the Institute for Industrial and Market Studies IIMS in 2009. Respondents named about 300 various business associations in response to the following openend question: Are you or other managers of your enterprise members of any business associationunion? If yes, what are these associa10IWH Discussion Papers 162011 __________________________________________________________________ IWH tionsunions?7 Therefore, presumably, Russia at present has about several hundred active business associations. 4 Previous Empirical Studies on Business Associations in Russia The first empirical study exploring business associations in the Russian economy was arguably an article by Recanatini Ryterman 2001. Drawing on conclusions from a famous paper by Blanchard Kremer 1997, the authors assumed that an important characteristic feature of transition economies was disorganization of economic links as a result of collapsed centralized planning and control. In the absence of alternative mechanisms for supplierconsumer coordination, this disorganization results in a dramatic slump in production. In this context, Recanatini and Ryterman view business associations as an institute of selforganization, supporting interfirm coordination and reducing transformation costs. Their analysis, drawing on the World Bank survey data of 19921994, showed that in the early 1990s, Russian firms members of business associations saw a lower decline in output, especially in cases when respective associations included both suppliers and consumers. However, these conclusions were based on a very small sample of only 157 firms, of which only 58 were members of business associations. Thereafter, interaction between Russian enterprises and business associations, including determinants and benefits of their membership, were analyzed in a number of empirical studies, based on more representative samples. Of particular note may be papers by Timothy Frye, William Pyle, Victoria Golikova and Stanislav Markus, drawing on major formalized business surveys. Using an original survey of 500 firms from all the sectors of the economy with the exception of agriculture and the social sector and conducted in eight Russian regions in 2000, Frye 2002 demonstrated that membership in business associations offers firms more lobbying power to influence legislation, especially at the regional and local levels. For example, Fryes data indicated that the probability that a member firm would lobby successfully at the regional level was 0.31, versus 0.11 for nonmembers Frye, 2002, p.1027. Frye also showed in this paper that firms enjoying government support have to face additional costs, including price regulation, more frequent inspections by various regulators, and higher business barriers Frye, 2002, p.1029. Drawing on these findings, Frye argued that a framework of exchange evolves between enterprises and government authorities first of all, at the regional level. 7 The list overlapped but did not coincide with the lists of collective members of top business associations, as the survey was focused exclusively on manufacturing, while RSPP, TPP and OPORA include associations from all sectors of the economy. IWH Discussion Papers 162011 11IWH __________________________________________________________________ Pyle 2007 2009, using data of the 20032004 surveys, shows that member firms are much more frequently asked to participate in working groups and advisory boards with government agencies. Moreover, business association members participating in such working groups are observed to have considerable influence on the drafting of laws and regulations. Further on, Pyle explored how enterprises respond to unplanned inspections by government regulators and supervisors e.g., Fire Safety Service, Sanitary and Epidemiological Service. The survey asked if respondents ever contested disagreeable unplanned inspections or their results and if they ever sought redress. The study showed that, ceteris paribus, association members more frequently appealed to arbitration courts and to government authorities to seek protection from the unfair actions of supervisory bodies. Another paper in this series Pyle, 2006 explores associations horizontal coordination functions and their role in facilitating interfirm information flows and provision of services to firms. Pyle describes how enterprises make use of the opportunities provided by their membership in business associations, including training, sharing new information about relevant markets, facilitation of investment, and introduction of new technologies and innovative practices. It is noteworthy that respondents generally gave a high assessment of the value of services provided by business associations. Further on, the article explores the relationship between association membership and member performance. Regression analysis reveals that association membership is positively associated with an increase in sales. These results offer less than satisfactory evidence of causation. However, they suggest that as far back as the early 2000s, business associations were joined by more proactive enterprises seeking assistance in investment attraction and implementation of innovations. At the same time, these enterprises demonstrated stronger growth. The literature focusing on firm membership determinants and the role of associations in firm activities and performance includes a noteworthy paper Golikova, 2009. The paper is based on a 2005 survey of 822 joint stock companies in manufacturing and communications. Further contributing to the results obtained by Pyle, regression analysis of the 2005 survey data showed that an important determinant of association membership is the administrative status of the city or town where the enterprise is based. Indeed, Moscowbased enterprises show the highest membership rates, followed by enterprises located in regional capitals and then come enterprises based in provincial towns and urban communities. Golikova also showed that association membership closely correlated with assistance received by enterprises from regional and local authorities. Membership in several associations was positively related to the probability of receiving both financial and administrative assistance from the authorities controlling for other variables, including firm size. A paper by Markus 2009 suggests a hypothesis that in the context of weak legal institutions, various alliances of enterprises with their counterparties foreign investors, government authorities or other firms from the same sector or region may emerge as in12IWH Discussion Papers 162011 __________________________________________________________________ IWH formal mechanisms of property rights protection. Guided by this approach, Markus interprets association membership as an indicator of enterprise integration in the business community, ensuring better protection from state predation and dishonest counterparty behavior. This hypothesis was built on earlier theoretical research and an analysis of 67 interviews with business leaders and government officials. The paper cites examples of cases in which business associations actually succeeded in building frameworks of resistance to illegitimate behaviors by bureaucrats. To test his hypothesis, Markus reviewed the results of the 2007 survey of 516 enterprises mostly industrial located in Russia and Ukraine. The findings of the regression analysis suggested that association membership was positively related to enterprise perceptions of security visavis illegitimate government actions and dishonest behavior of the counterparties. 5 The Data In our own study, we used data from a survey of 957 Russian enterprises conducted from February to June of 2009 as part of the second round of manufacturing competitiveness monitoring by the Higher School of Economics Institute for Industrial and Market Studies IIMS and the Levada Center commissioned by the Ministry for Economic Development. According to the monitoring program, the survey asked questions about the density of competition, investments, export and innovation activities, ownership and control, business interaction with the authorities, labor and other factor markets. Two questions asked about firm membership in business associations. The surveyed enterprises represent eight manufacturing industries, classified according to the AllRussian Classification of Economic Activities: food processing, textiles and garments, timber and woodworking, chemicals, metals and fabricated metal goods, electrical, electronic and optical equipment, transport vehicles and equipment and machines and equipment. The enterprises were located in 48 Russian regions, with most surveyed firms based in regional capital cities 45 percent, excluding Moscow and provincial towns and cities under republican, regional and district jurisdictions 41%.8 In 68% of cases, questionnaires were directed at general and executive directors, 31% were directed at deputy general directors for economics and finance, and only in 14 cases did respondents hold other positions. The survey focused on mediumsized and large enterprises rather than on superlarge and large ones. About 14% of the sample employed fewer than 100 workers, 55% employed between 100 and 500, and 31% had workforces in excess of 500. Most enterprises 75% were founded before 1992, while 15% were established between 1992 and 1998. 8 Apart from that, 6% of enterprises were located in Moscow, and 8% in urban or rural communities. IWH Discussion Papers 162011 13IWH __________________________________________________________________ Twenty eight percent of the sample enterprises were part of business groups, 10% had foreign shareholders, and 11% included the state among their owners. To describe regional variation, the survey used the Expert RA regional investment potential rating. Regions with low investment potential hosted 41% of the surveyed firms, while 30% were located in highpotential regions. The surveyed enterprises employed about 8% of the total payroll in manufacturing, producing about 6% of manufacturing output in 2007. In addition to a formalized survey of businesses in the spring of 2010, we also undertook a series of indepth, nonformalized interviews with heads of 23 business associations in four Russian regions. The interviews helped us to obtain a better understanding of how enterprises interact with associations. 6 Descriptive Statistics To assess the rates of firm membership in business associations, the results of the 2009 survey were compared with Pyles 2003 screening survey data and the findings of two other surveys administered by the Higher School of Economics in 2005 and 2007. Summary membership data for 2005, 2007 and 2009 are presented in Table 1. Table 1: Rates of firm membership in business associations BA Sector Manufacturing Communications Commerce Transport Construction Other Sampling description 2003 2005 2007 2009 Average size 485 Share of BA members 34,2% 1353 industrial enterprises in 48 Russian regions Average size 1545 5780 Share of BA members 45.5% 38.0% 822 JSCs in 64 Russian regions Average size 617 274 168 819 256 404 Share of BA members 36.6% 38.9% 9.7% 25.0% 29.4% 43.5% Average size 587 Share of BA members 38.5% 507 firms in 8 regions of European Russia 957 manufacturing firms in 48 Russian regions The coverage of sectors varied strongly, depending on the year of the survey. In 2003, Pyles sample included enterprises from seven manufacturing industries. The HSE samples of 2005 embraced manufacturing and communications firms, while the survey of 2007 essentially covered all of the key economy sectors, albeit with a narrower regional coverage. The survey of 2009 focused exclusively on manufacturing eight sectors overlapping but not coinciding with Pyles sample. 14IWH Discussion Papers 162011 __________________________________________________________________ IWH Further, the sample of 2005 is different by focusing exclusively on joint stock companies. The data in Table 1 show that the sample is largely skewed toward larger firms, which have a traditionally stronger membership in business associations. The 2007 data are of particular interest because they represent all the key sectors. These data suggest that the lowest participation rate was observable in commerce under 10%. The highest rate of membership in business associations about 40% was seen in industry, communications and other sectors including banks and other financial institutions and real estate agencies. The 2009 survey data are generally incomparable with the 2005 and 2007 data. However, because the 2009 study is representative of the total manufacturing sector, while the 2007 survey is representative of appropriate sectors for the eight regions for which it was administered, it may be possible to compare the results of both surveys obtained for manufacturing enterprises. A similar comparison is possible for the 2003 data. Data in Table 2 suggest that these results are quite close, showing a nascent trend for growth: in 2009, 38.5% of surveyed firms reported their engagement in business associations, compared with 37% of industrial respondents in 2007 and 34% in 2003. It should be noted that higher membership rates in 2005 45.5% may be related to the considerably larger average size of firms included in that sample. Therefore, overall, previous survey results suggest that since mid2000, about 40% of manufacturing companies have belonged to business associations. Further on in the paper, drawing on descriptive statistics of the 2009 survey, we will review the key characteristics of firms participating in business associations. Association membership and perception of its value. The 2009 survey not only asked respondents whether they were members of business associations but also to provide the names of the associations to which they belonged. Using the results, a database of business associations was built, with an option to further add data from available sources. Drawing on this database, a classification of associations was constructed to be extensively used in further analysis. In contrast to the previous surveys, this classification may be viewed as more accurate and informative. Specifically, the HSE surveys of 2005 and 2007 and the baseline survey by Pyle in 2004 asked respondents to classify their associations into various categories, e.g., national, sectorspecific and regionspecific. Indeed, in the absence of data on association names, there was no way to verify the accuracy of such classification. In addition to the detailed question about the names of associations, respondents were also asked to comment on the value of membership. However, the questionnaires did not offer multiplechoice answers, as the task was to briefly describe in ones own words the benefits of membership for the enterprise. Responses to this question helped to identify those enterprises that found their membership useful. Figure 1 shows that IWH Discussion Papers 162011 15IWH __________________________________________________________________ 19% of respondents of the 38% who responded positively to the membership question found their association membership useful for their business. However, it is noteworthy that about 4% of all the respondents about 11% of association members reported membership but found it difficult to provide at least an approximate name of the association to which they belonged. In our view, such responses are evidence that these enterprises not only receive no benefits from association membership, but also do not even participate in their activities, nor do they bear any related costs. Therefore, in further analysis, they were grouped together with nonmembers.9 Figure 1: Association membership and perception of membership usefulness 19%15%4%62%Nonmembers of BAMembers, but do not remember name Members, but do not perceive membership useful Members; perceive membership useful In addition to exploring the overall impact of association membership, this analysis also sought to understand how this impact depends on the characteristics of associations. In particular, with regard to the findings of earlier research and data from indepth qualitative interviews, we differentiated among the following three categories of associations: top nationwide associations RSPP, OPORA and Delovaya Rossiya, including their regional affiliates, drawing their membership from across sectors and regions; sectorspecific associations, drawing their nationwide membership from one sector or many regions; regionspecific associations, drawing their membership from one region and usually only one sector. A separate group included the Chamber of Commerce and Industry TPP and its regional affiliates. This separation was related to a special legal status of chambers of commerce and industry in Russia they operate on the basis of a special law and the TPPs monopoly for servicing enterprises in certification of goods for exports and im 9 This approach was validated by regression analysis. All the model specifications showed that this category was indistinguishable from nonmembers. 16IWH Discussion Papers 162011 __________________________________________________________________ IWH ports. This circumstance, in particular, explains TPPs weak dependence on membership fees as revealed by our 2010 indepth interviews with business associations officials, membership fees do not account for more than 510% of regional TPP budgets. Our survey showed that 50% of member firms participated in sectoral associations, 37% in regional associations, 20% in TPP and only 14.5% were members of the top three associations RSPP, OPORA and Delovaya Rossia. Roughly one in every four enterprises was a member of two or more business associations. Figure 2 presents an estimate of BA membership value, depending on the type of association. The data show that about 64% of firms belonging to TPP or top associations reported their membership to be useful. This share is somewhat lower for sectorspecific associations 61% and significantly lower for regional associations only 53%. Figure 2: Value of membership across various types of associations TPPRSPP Umbrella 64%64%Regional 53%Sectorspecific 61%40%45%50%55%60%65%70% Regional variation. Another important observation relates to considerable variation of association membership across enterprises located in communities of different administrative status. Figure 3 shows that the proportion of association membership is considerably higher 42% for firms located in regional and republican capitals excluding Moscow. Other communities show much lower membership rates of similar levels, 2528%.

This observation is broadly consistent with a conclusion by Doner Schneider 2000 that business associations tend to be more active if exposed to higher external pressures.10 Further on in the paper, this observation will be verified by regression analysis.

A tentative analysis on the basis of bivariable distributions see Table 2 also suggests that members show a significantly higher innovative and investment activity and better management. However, they demonstrate a considerably lower rate of rankandfile members of business groups while parent companies are practically equally distributed between members and nonmembers of associations.

The index aggregates responses to the question on managerial innovations, takes on the values from 1 through 9. The index is constructed on the basis of the following values of the original variable: 0 no investment in 20052008; 1 insignificant investments, 2 major investments Another interesting observation is related to differences in ownership structure. With a roughly equal compared with the sample average share of governmentowned companies, association members featured a considerably higher share of companies with foreign equity. On the other hand, association membership was lower in the group of companies that refused to respond to the survey question about their ownership structure. Business association membership and interaction with state actors. To determine how association membership impacts firm relations with government authorities, the questionnaire included a number of specially designed questions. First, respondents were asked if their enterprise provided any assistance to regional andor local authorities in regional social development in 20072008 e.g., maintenance of social facilities and housing or sponsor support to regionalmunicipal programs. IWH Discussion Papers 162011 19IWH __________________________________________________________________ If the response was affirmative, respondents were asked to provide a rough estimate of the average annual amount of their assistance as a ratio of their sales proceeds. Figure 5 presents a distribution of responses. Only 23% of firms did not provide any assistance to the authorities, while the overwhelming majority of the other enterprises 56.5% estimated their assistance as marginal: respondents were either undecided about its size or indicated that it was under 0.1% of their sales. For the purpose of regression analysis, we aligned the responses to this question and constructed an ordinal variable taking five values from 0 through 4. Figure 5: Assistance by firms to regional and local authorities 6,1%14,5%22,9%No assistance Some assistance, difficult to estimate the scale Assistance of up to 0.1% of sales 32,6%23,9%Assistance of 0.10.3% of sales Assistance of above 0.3% of sales Second, respondents were asked to indicate separately if their enterprise received any financial andor administrative assistance from federal, regional and local authorities in 20072008.11 Figure 6 shows rates of positive responses. 11 Administrative support means any nonfinancial support, including assistance in interaction with other state actors and business partners, becoming connected to infrastructure networks and plots of land. 20IWH Discussion Papers 162011 __________________________________________________________________ IWH Figure 6: Receipt of financial and administrative support from various levels of government Federal authorities Regional authorities 6,2%10,1%19,0%14,3%Local authorities 5,7%17,5%0,0%5,0%10,0%15,0%20,0%Received administrative support Received financial support Apparently, local and regional authorities significantly and more frequently provided administrative support to businesses, while federal authorities were largely focused on financial instruments of support. Of greater note, regional authorities were generally more active in supporting enterprises. Further on, we used three binary variables to reflect the support financial andor administrative received from federal, regional and local authorities, respectively. Table 3 presents summary data on assistance to the authorities and receipt of government support by member and nonmember enterprises. Table 3 Membership in BA and relations with various levels of government Members of BA Nonmembers of BA 26% 57% 17% 12% 21% 17% Provision of assistance to regional and local government authorities Receipt of assistance from government authorities of various levels No assistance Under 0.1% of sales or no response on the size Above 0.1% of sales Federal level Regional level Local level 17% 57% 27% 16% 34% 25% Paired comparisons of averages suggest that association members are broadly more active in providing assistance to regional and local authorities and also tend to receive regional and local government support more frequently. Federal support also shows some bias toward association members, but it is less noticeable. IWH Discussion Papers 162011 21 IWH __________________________________________________________________ 7 Main Hypotheses and Research Strategy Drawing on summary results of previous research and our preliminary consideration of the 2009 survey data, we have formulated the following hypotheses to analyze factors influencing decisions to join associations: 1. We assume that business associations are more frequently joined by: a Larger enterprises. This effect relates to the fact that big players find it easier to agree on collective action Olson, 1965. Moreover, given the sheer scale of their businesses, they can be more strongly affected by changes in the rules of the game, while bearing roughly similar lobbying costs. This effect has been noted in many studies, including those based on Russias data Pyle, 2006; Golikova, 2009, but nevertheless, we wanted to test it against our data. Big players should also have a stronger position in the business association. A smaller firm normally would be a rankandfile member with few chances to advance its interests, while a larger company may be a more efficient lobbyist. In other words, larger companies are better positioned to influence the rules of the game. b Firms located in regional capital cities. In smaller towns, authorities are more accessible. Therefore, mediumsized and large companies do not need special organizations to interact with government officials, while coordination of business activities of enterprises may be achieved via informal meetings of their managers. In contrast, in Moscow, the high number of enterprises is an impediment to collective action, while officials are accessible only to the largest enterprises or to the most highprofile associations. Against this backdrop, regional capitals have a manageable but not too small number of enterprises. Access to the governor for an individual enterprise especially if it is mediumsized may be restricted, but collective appeals on behalf of a sector may have effect. On balance, regional capital cities seem to offer an optimal combination of business concentration and access to government. Saving time and transport costs may also play a role: to maintain contacts with the authorities, business association offices should be located in administrative centers Moscow and regional capital cities. However, in this case, the firms based in the same administrative centers would have lower costs of contacting with associations. c Firms active in exports, investment and innovation. Such modernizing activities of firms result in more external restrictions for them in the business environment.12 This fact has been recorded in many studies see Golikova et al. 2007, Yakovlev and Frye 2007, and it may be interpreted as a stronger pressure on ac 12 In particular, investing, exporting and innovative firms inevitably would have more counterparties or would have more complicated relations with them. Therefore, such firms would run higher risks of contractual nonperformance and other violations of property rights and, consequently, would have higher requirements to the quality of business environment. 22IWH Discussion Papers 162011 __________________________________________________________________ IWH tive enterprises, in the language of Doner Schneider 2000. Accordingly, such enterprises may be more motivated towards collective action, seeking to change the rules of the game. d Firms with foreign equity. Foreign investors, who traditionally prefer official and legal channels to address their business problems, may find business associations attractive as an instrument of civilized public interaction with the authorities 2. We assume that business associations are less frequently joined by: a Subsidiaries in business groups. Their lower participation rates in business associations may be accounted for by the fact that their interests are taken care of by their parent companies, which lobby for them at various levels. Additionally, the function of horizontal cooperation development which is a frequent role of business associations internationally see Doner Schneider 2000, Locke 2001 may be less relevant for enterprises belonging to business groups. Their technological development and more efficient inclusion in value chains will normally occur within their business groups, supervised by the parent company. b Firms that do not respond regarding their ownership structure. Membership in business associations suggests the firms willingness to cooperate with other companies, to act in a public space and to disclose information about itself. Therefore, we may anticipate that nontransparent companies identified by no response to the ownership question would be less inclined to participate in business associations. Regarding business association membership implications for businessgovernment interface, the following hypotheses were formulated: 3. Business associations are mediators between government and business and serve as a mechanism to facilitate exchanges between business and the state, as explored by T.Frye Frye, 2002 and supported by further research Yakovlev, 2007; Yakovlev, 2010. Therefore, we may assume that a Association members provide more frequent assistance to regional and local authorities in regional social development; b Association members more frequently receive government support. 4. Associations of different types will provide different kinds of access to government support for their members. These variations may be related to membership coverage and associations focus on different activities. In this context we may hypothesize that: a Government support would more frequently go to enterprises belonging to top and sectorspecific business associations. Because these associations are more broadbased, they may have a better negotiating capacity in their interaction with govIWH Discussion Papers 162011 23IWH __________________________________________________________________ ernment, and therefore, they may be more successful in securing government support for their members. b Members of TPP do not enjoy any preferences in receiving access to government support because, judging by indepth qualitative interviews, the TPP network is more focused on provision of business services rather than on lobbying the interests of its members. The hypotheses regarding factors influencing association membership were tested in a series of probittype regressions. Business association membership was a binary dependent variable 0 nonmember, 1 member. Explanatory variables included firm size, administrative status of their home citytown, ownership structure state participation, foreign equity, no response, and membership in business groups. Further specifications of the model additionally included export activities, major investments, and technological and managerial innovations. Results were controlled for the sector, economic development of the region groupings by investment potential ratings and the time of firm establishment. To explore interaction with government, during the first stage, we used ordinal probit regressions, where assistance to regional and local authorities in the social development of the region was included as a dependent variable 0 no assistance; 4 assistance of above 0.3% of sales. Four dummies capturing membership in a sectorspecific, regional, peak associations and TPP were used as explanatory variables. In addition to controlling for the sector, economic development of the region and time of establishment, we also used controls for all the variables earlier included in the membership determinants regression. This exercise resulted in identifying the net effect of association membership influencing assistance to government, unrelated to the factors influencing firms decisions to join business associations. A similar approach was used during the second stage while assessing factors influencing provision of government support. Respective probit regressions used dummies for receipt of government support from federal, regional and local authorities as dependant variables, and dummies for firm participation in sectorspecific, regional, top peak associations and the TPP as explanatory variables. For controls, we used all the variables included in the models during the first stage, including the provision of assistance to authorities. 8 Regression analysis Results Firmspecific characteristics influence on business association membership. To determine to what extent business association membership is influenced by firmspecific characteristics, we used probittype assessments. Key results are provided in Table 4. 24IWH Discussion Papers 162011 __________________________________________________________________ IWH Regression analysis has confirmed the findings of previous research about a positive relationship between enterprise size and the probability of its membership in a business association. Replacement of the log employees with firm categories by size revealed a threshold, i.e., firms employing over 500 workers tended to participate in associations much more frequently, while differences among othersized groups proved insignificant. Location in a regional capital increased the probability of association membership by 13 percentage points visavis firms from provincial capitals p0.01 in all the model specifications. In the group of modernization activity determinants, high significance for association participation was shown by managerial and technological innovation and investment 0.01 for all these factors, with a lower significance demonstrated by ISO certification 0.10 and zero significance of exporting operations. The assumption of a positive relationship between foreign equity and association membership was not confirmed, with the respective coefficients positive but not significant The hypothesis of a negative relationship between business group membership as rankandfile members and association membership was confirmed at the 5% level of statistic significance. Finally, noresponse to ownership questions proved to be negatively related to business association participation. This correlation was highly significant p0.01 in all the model specifications. This group of enterprises showed a 15% percentage point lower number of association members, with the sample average of 34% excluding firms that failed to give names of associations where they belonged. Assistance to regional and local authorities. Correlation between association membership and assistance to regional and local authorities was explored by ordered probit regressions. The intensity of assistance was described by the ordinal variable described above. Two approaches were utilized to describe association membership. One approach used a binary variable capturing membership in any type of association. The other approach employed a series of binary variables capturing membership in associations of different types according to the classification above. Thus, effects of membership in these associations can be compared. The computed outputs are shown in Tables 5a and 5b. A calculation using the aggregated membership variable reveals that, on average, association members tend to more actively assist regional and local authorities. However, a further analysis indicated that the intensity of assistance varies depending on the association type. A stronger and more statistically significant effect is found exclusively in the case of membership in sectorspecific associations. Membership in regional business associations and TPP shows a statistically insignificant and weak positive effect. ImporIWH Discussion Papers 162011 25IWH __________________________________________________________________ tantly, the coefficient for the variable capturing membership in nationwide associations RSPP, OPORA and Delovaya Rossia has a rather high value while remaining statistically insignificant. This may be related to a relatively low number of such enterprises in the sample Enterprise size is positively related to businessgovernment cooperation, with a higher share of revenues spent by larger enterprises on assistance to government authorities. Noticeably more frequent is assistance to authorities from innovative enterprises, enterprises active in investment, ISOcertified enterprises and enterprises enhancing management. The fact that the association membership effect is robust to inclusion of control variables implies that association membership as such is positively related to more active assistance to government. Association membership and support from government. Three dummies for receipt of support from federal, regional and local authorities were used as dependent variables. Association membership was captured in an aggregate variable in one case membernonmember of any type of association, and in the other case, it is captured in a number of variables describing types of associations. Because government support may be a result of the enterprises assistance to the authorities, a respective variable was included in regressions as a control. Tables 6 8 present results of analyzing the possible influence of various factors on the probability of receiving support from federal, regional and local authorities. As evidenced by the data, business associations proved insignificant for receiving federal support. Moreover, this result was consistent across all types of associations. However, it may be noteworthy that the assistance provided by the enterprise to regional and local authorities had a very weak effect on getting support from federal authorities. Support was received by enterprises of higher national importance, i.e., large or parent companies. More frequently, federal support went to governmentowned enterprises and firms based in underdeveloped regions. Regarding support from regional and local authorities, association membership was positively correlated with getting support. An analysis by types of associations resulted in the following findings: Regional authorities tend to much more frequently by 19 percentage points on average support nationallevel association members. Membership in sectorspecific associations increased the probability of receiving support by 13 percentage points. The coefficient capturing the effect from regional association membership was bordering statistical insignificance slightly above seven percentage points. The effect from participation in TPP was negative though statistically insignificant. Other significant factors influencing probability of support from regional authorities included assistance to regional authorities in the social development of the region. Overall, regional authorities tended to be more supportive of larger and more proactive en26IWH Discussion Papers 162011 __________________________________________________________________ IWH terprises which made major investments in 20072008, implemented innovations and demonstrated a higher level of management. The local level exhibited similar trends. Most frequently, support went to members of nationallevel associations 15 percentage points versus nonmembers, and somewhat less frequently, it was provided to members of sectorspecific and regional associations 79 percentage points. TPP members tended to receive support less frequently, as in the case of regional authorities, but the variance remained insignificant. Apart from association members, support was noticeably more frequently enjoyed by unitary enterprises and companies with foreign equity. Neither the size nor modernization activities of enterprises had any significant impact on local government decisions to provide support. An interesting finding was received regarding the group of enterprises that did not respond to the question on the ownership structure. As noted above, those enterprises less frequently joined business associations. They also less frequently provided assistance to the authorities in the social development of the region but significantly more frequently received regional and local government support. In sum, it may suggest that this group is dominated by enterprises affiliated with local and regional officials. 9 Discussion and Conclusions The quantitative analysis suggests the following. The proportion of manufacturing companies belonging to business associations is close to 40%, exhibiting a marginal trend for growth if compared with earlier survey evidence. Over half of the member companies perceive their membership in business associations useful. Regression analysis of the data of the 2009 survey show that larger enterprises and firms in regional capitals more often join business associations. We can suppose that precisely this type of city offers the opportunity to achieve an optimal combination of concentrated business activity with possible access to authorities. Membership in associations also proved to be related to activity of the firms in investment and innovation. The reason may be that the enterprises that are expanding the scope of their activities are more often facing problems in the business environment, such that they have more incentives to join efforts to change it, using business associations as one of instruments to do so. In our regression analysis, we also have singled out the factors that lower the likelihood of membership in business associations. One of these factors is belonging to an integrated business group holding group. We believe that enterprises of this type can more easily solve their problems in their parent companies, which usually belong to nationwide business associations. At the same time, business groups may we unwilling to see that their subsidiaries independently cooperate with firms of similar profiles in industrywide and regional associations. IWH Discussion Papers 162011 27IWH __________________________________________________________________ Another negative factor is the refusal of our respondents to answer the question about ownership structure. In our opinion, membership in enterprise organizations presumes that a firm is ready to disclose certain information about itself. Thus, the firms that are unwilling to disclose information about themselves would be less inclined to join the associations. Our regression analysis has also confirmed that business associations are a component of what Frye 2002 calls an elite exchange although only on regional and local levels. These exchanges imply that members of business associations, on the one hand, more actively assist regional and local authorities in social development of their regions, and on the other hand, they more often receive support from authorities. However, this effect is insignificant in terms of support from the federal government. The most active participants in this system of exchanges are member enterprises from industry and nationwide leading associations RSPP, OPORA and Delovaya Rossia. This may be due to their strong bargaining power in their relations with regional and local authorities. However, the exchange effects that we have discovered are not related to members of chambers of trade and industry. This may be due to the fact that the system of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry is mostly focused on providing business services rather than on lobbying interests of its members. In general, our results allow us to believe that at present, business associations especially the industrywide and leading ones consolidate the most active, advanced companies and act as collective representatives of their interests. For this reason, business associations can be regarded as interface units between the authorities and businesses and as a possible instrument for promotion of economic development. 28IWH Discussion Papers 162011 __________________________________________________________________ IWH References Blanchard, O.
