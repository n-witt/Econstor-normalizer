IZA Discussion Paper No. 1472 January 2005 ABSTRACT Autopsy on an Empire: Understanding Mortality in Russia and the Former Soviet Union Male life expectancy at birth fell by over six years in Russia between 1989 and 1994. Many other countries of the former Soviet Union saw similar declines, and female life expectancy fell as well. Using crosscountry and Russian household survey data, we assess six possible explanations for this upsurge in mortality. Most find little support in the data: the deterioration of the health care system, changes in diet and obesity, and material deprivation fail to explain the increase in mortality rates. The two factors that do appear to be important are alcohol consumption, especially as it relates to external causes of death homicide, suicide, and accidents and stress associated with a poor outlook for the future. However, a large residual remains to be explained.

The 1990s were a decade of turmoil for the formerly socialist countries. Besides thepolitical, economic and social upheavals endured by these populations, many of these countriesalso experienced a demographic disaster in the form of sharply rising death rates. In Russia,male life expectancy at birth fell from 64.2 years in 1989 to 57.6 years in 1994, a decline of 6.6years in just half a decade. Female life expectancy at birth fell by 3.3 years over the same timeperiod. To put this in perspective, it took the past 30 years for the United States to increase lifeexpectancy by this much. Russias life expectancy today ranks 122 in the world, at the samendlevel as North Korea and Guyana.The mortality crisis is not limited to Russia. Across the western countries of the former Soviet Union the countries which we term the mortality belt and which range from Estonia inthe north to Ukraine in the south there have been significant declines in male life expectancy atbirth, ranging from 3.3 years Belarus to nearly 5 years in Estonia and Latvia see Figure 1. Life expectancy for women fell substantially as well. But not all countries fared this poorly. The countries which directly border this mortalitybelt and which also experienced a severe economic shock in the 1990s Poland, the Czech and Slovak Republics, Hungary, and Romania recorded negligible increases in mortality ratesduring their transition from communism, and since the mid1990s many of these countries haveenjoyed the fastest increases in life expectancy recorded in their recent history.Understanding why mortality in Russia and many of its neighboring countries increasedso rapidly is a central research and policy question. Analysts of the Russian experience, forexample, describe the mortality profile as the most puzzling aspect of the Russian transitionShleifer and Treisman 2003. A number of theories have been put forward about the mortalitycrisis: the breakdown of the medical care system Ellman 1994; increased alcohol consumption 2Leon et al. 1997; a reduction in material living standards, as reflected in diet and nutritionField 1995; increased stress from the economic transition Shapiro 1995; Cornia and Paniccia 2000; and a reduced outlook for the future Watson 1995. Some progress on understanding the mortality crisis has been made by researchers. Epidemiologists have studied Russian mortality data at the national level to decompose changesin death rates by cause of death and age group Leon et al. 1997; Shkolnikov et al. 2001a andhave interviewed relatives of deceased men to identify characteristics associated with anincreased probability of dying Shkolnikov et al. 2001b. Medical researchers have examined theprevalence of biological risk factors for cardiovascular disease in Russia and other countries ofthe former Soviet Union Kristenson et al. 1997; Puska et al. 1993; Stegmayr et al. 2000, andhave studied the course of epidemic diseases across Russia and the response of the health systemto these epidemics Vitek et al. 1999; Kalichman et al. 2000.Using these findings and our own analysis of crosscountry and Russian survey data, wediscuss and analyze possible causes of the mortality crisis in the former Soviet Union, as well asthe equally puzzling dramatic improvement in mortality rates in the late 1990s in most countries.We begin by describing the overall trends in death rates in the region, providing anoverview of changes in mortality by region, age and cause. Russia is not unique: other former Soviet countries experienced changes in mortality remarkably similar to those of Russia duringthe transition period. Moreover, virtually every country in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union experienced at least a shortterm increase in death rates among certain demographicgroups. But Russia is different in that the mortality crisis is particularly acute among prime agemen not the elderly or infants, the groups most commonly thought to be at risk because ofeconomic change.3We next explore the possible causes of the dramatic swings in mortality across the region,focusing on six broad factors: changes in the health care system; traditional risk factors such asobesity and smoking; increased alcohol consumption; changes in the composition of the diet;material deprivation; and levels of stress and changing expectations about the future. Severalfactors are easy to dispose of. Although the medical system in the former Soviet Uniondeteriorated significantly, we find no evidence that this deterioration played a major role in thedemographic disaster. Nor is smoking, obesity, or undernutrition the problem. In the end, our results point to two factors as being most important, alcohol, especially asit relates to external causes of death homicide, suicide, and accidents and stress associated witha poor outlook for the future. We find that these two factors are of roughly equal importance inaccounting for the dramatic increase in mortality in Russia though we caution that there is stilla large residual to be explained.I.Mortality trends in the Former Soviet Union We start off by examining mortality trends in Russia and the former Soviet Union. Theobvious question that arises in any analysis of the former Soviet Union is data quality. Manystatistics about the former Soviet bloc are not reliable. Demographic data are believed to be anexception, however: registration of vital events is nearly complete, and the coding of broadcategories of death is reasonably accurate Anderson and Silver 1997; Shkolnikov et al. 1997;Shkolnikov et al. 1999; Shkolnikov et al. 2002. As a result, there is widespread agreementamong demographers and epidemiologists that the fluctuations in mortality rates we describe are 4real and do not reflect a radical change in the vital registration system.1Figure 2 illustrates the erratic changes in life expectancy experienced in most countries ofthe former Soviet Union in recent years, in contrast to the slowly evolving changes in lifeexpectancy recorded in the United States and other industrialized countries. The top panelFigure 2a shows life expectancy for the mortality belt countries. By the early 1960s life 2expectancy in the Soviet Union had nearly reached that of the United States within 3 years. Mortality failed to improve over the next decade, however, and a large EastWest life expectancygap emerged. By 1980, the difference in life expectancy was nearly 8 years.The post1984 period is marked by large swings in life expectancy. There was a strikingimprovement in mortality during Gorbachevs antialcohol campaign 19851987, when lifeexpectancy increased nearly three years. From there, however, the situation deteriorated dramatically. The deterioration began inearnest in 1990 and lasted until the mid1990s, coincident with the period of greatest economic,political, and social instability in most countries. The 6 year reduction in male life expectancy atbirth in Russia between 1989 and 1994 is almost unprecedented in its speed and scope, though itwas nearly matched by the declines in life expectancy in many of Russias western neighbors. Over the same period, male life expectancy fell by 4.6 years in Estonia, 4.5 years in Latvia, 4.2years in Lithuania, and 3.7 and 3.3 years, respectively, in Ukraine and Belarus. 1Despite the generally high quality of the demographic data in the region, however, it should benoted that the mortality data are less reliable in some countries of Central Asia and the Caucuses. Inconsistencies in the reporting of deaths at the oldest ages have been reported in some countries, and Georgia implemented a fee for death registration in the early 1990s, which likely led to underreporting ofdeaths Badurashvili et al. 2001. Data for these countries should be interpreted with caution. 2Figure 2a omits Latvia to reduce clutter; the level and change in male life expectancy in Latviais nearly identical to that of Estonia. Male and female life expectancy for all transition countries areshown in Appendix Figure 1. All data prior to 1991 are for the Soviet republics individually rather thanfor the USSR as a whole.5After 1994, the situation began to improve. Between 1994 and 1998, life expectancy in Russia increased by over 3 years. Most of the gains were eroded, however, following Russias 1998 financial crisis; male life expectancy has fallen continually from peak of 61.3 years in 1998to only 58.5 years in 2002.Figure 2b shows mortality in the Central Asian republics. Life expectancy fell in thesecountries as well, but the declines were neither as dramatic nor longlasting as in the westernformer Soviet Union. Kazakhstan registered the largest decline in life expectancy in this group,with male life expectancy at birth falling by five years between 1989 and 1996; the smallestdecline in this region occurred in Uzbekistan, where male life expectancy fell by 1.6 yearsbetween 1990 and 1994. Among the three Caucuses countries Armenia, Azerbaijan, and 3Georgia declines in life expectancy ranged from 1.6 years Armenia to 4.2 years Azerbaijanin the early 1990s. Remarkably, despite substantial declines in per capita income, rising unemployment, anda wide range of reform experiences, none of the East European countries experienced aprolonged decline in life expectancy in the 1990s, and some did not see any material setbackFigure 2c. The most successful economic reformers the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary,and Slovenia registered nearcontinual increases in life expectancy since the start of theirreforms. This differs not only with the neighboring mortality belt countries, but also with theexperience of the previous three decades, in which life expectancy stagnated in a pattern similarto that of the Soviet Union. Life expectancy fell in Bulgaria and Romania, but these declines aresmall relative to those that occurred in the western region of the former Soviet Union.3Tajikistan is omitted from the analysis in this paper due to the civil war that plagued the countryin the early 1990s, and which led to a decline in male life expectancy from 66 to 56 years between 1992and 1993. The quality of the demographic data in Tajikistan is also considered to be relatively poor.6In the Appendix, we show similar figures for female life expectancy at birth. Thepatterns are very similar, although the magnitude of the changes is smaller. Changes in mortality are clearly related to the economic health of the country. Figure 3shows the relation in more detail: we relate the log change in agestandardized male mortalitybetween 1989 and 1994 to the log change in real per capita GDP over the same time period. 4The two are highly related the correlation coefficient is .60. Countries like Ukraine with pooreconomic growth had very large increases in mortality. Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovenia are on the opposite end. Even in the context of this relationship, however, Russia is anoutlier: mortality increased more than could be expected given the change in reported GDP, andthe mortality increase is even more extreme if the decline in Russias GDP is substantiallyoverstated as is likely to be the case Shleifer and Treisman 2003. The relationship betweenmortality change and GDP growth is less true over the subsequent years of the 1990s, as thesecond panel in Figure 3 details. The correlation between mortality change in the 1994 to 2000period and economic growth over the same period is only .13. All told, over the entire 1989 to 2000 era, the correlation between reported mortality changes and GDP growth is .55.The strong correlation between mortality change and economic growth begs a moredetailed analysis. What are the economic mechanisms that underlie the strong link betweeneconomic growth and health? Why did the relationship get weaker over time? Any why is Russia still such an outlier? These are the questions we proceed to examine.Deaths by Age, Cause, and Socioeconomic Status 4There are substantial issues involved in measuring output changes across countries Shleifer and Treisman 2003. It would be better to use a measure other than official GDP, but we do not have the datafor all countries to do this. For several countries GDP data are missing for 1989, so Figure 3 uses 1990data instead. Georgia, BosniaHerzegovina, FYR Macedonia, and Serbia are omitted due to missing data.7As a start in understanding why mortality rose so rapidly, we present some moredisaggregated information on mortality in Russia; trends for the other mortality belt countries arereported in the Appendix, and look similar. We look at the period from 1989 to 1994, the yearsof the largest increase in death rates. Figure 4 shows changes in mortality rates by age, separatelyfor men and women. There has been a dramatic increase in prime age mortality in Russia. Thedeath rate for men aged 3544 rose by 74 percent between 1989 and 1994. Similar increaseswere seen throughout the other working ages. The pattern for women is similar, but themagnitudes are smaller mortality for 3544 year old women rose by 59 percent over the period. The Russian elderly of the 1990s had very difficult lives. Born in a period spanning civilwar and revolution 19171921, the famines and purges of the 1930s, and the hardships of World War II, it is possible that these catastrophic events impacted the future mortality of thesegenerations. Indeed, a substantial public health literature focuses on the impact of early lifeevents on late life mortality either in utero Barker, 1992 or in childhood Kermack et al.,2001. But the increase in mortality in the 1990s does not seem related to this factor. Mortalityamong men aged 6574 rose by only 25 percent between 1989 and 1994; for men aged 7584,mortality rates increased by 14 percent. For elderly women, mortality rates rose by 18 and 15percent, respectively, in the 6574 and 7584 age groups. Indeed, the age group with the largestincrease in mortality was born in about 1950, after World War II and the worst of the hardshipsof the Stalin era.Figure 5 shows data on cause of death, again differentially for men and women. Each barin the chart is the share of total increase in mortality accounted for by that cause between 1989and 1994. For example, the first bar shows that 42 percent of the increase in male mortality wasthe result of greater mortality from cardiovascular disease; within this category, 21 percent of the 8total increase in male mortality 12 of the cardiovascular disease total was due to the increase indeaths due to ischaemic heart disease. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in Russia, as in the United States, so the importance of this change is not surprising. Still, themagnitude of the increase in such a short period of time is unusual. We typically think ofcardiovascular disease as a longterm process responding to life events building up over manyyears or decades; the Russian data suggest otherwise. Given the importance of cardiovasculardisease in accounting for the mortality crisis, we examine this factor extensively in our empiricalwork.Second in importance is external causes of death. The most important items in thiscategory are accidental alcohol poisoning, unspecified violent deaths, homicide and suicide. Awellhidden secret of the Soviet Union was the extremely high death rate due to external causes. In 1989, for example, the standardized death rate due to external causes among men in Russiawas over three times the European Union average 200.3 deaths per 100,000 population versus 62.9 deaths per 100,000, and for women the rate was twice as high.Deaths due to external causes rose dramatically in Russia in the early 1990s, virtuallydoubling for both men and women. These changes account for onefifth women to onethirdmen of the total increase in deaths between 1989 and 1994. Both suicide and homicide areimportant across the region; by the mid1990s Lithuania had achieved the dubious distinction ofhaving the highest male suicide rate in the world. We return to this cause, especially as it relatesto alcohol, at a later point.While many causes of death have increased, others fell. In all countries of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, infant and child mortality rates declined throughout the 1990s; indeed, without these declines the fall in life expectancy in the mortality belt would 9have been even more dramatic. Infants and the elderly are typically the most vulnerable groupsin the population. In countries facing economic shocks, mortality often increases in these agesthe most Cutler et al. 2002. As in so many other ways, however, the countries of the former Soviet Union are different. Official data do not differentiate deaths by socioeconomic status nor do they in the United States, but other evidence suggests that mortality rates increased the most among lowersocioeconomic groups. For example, Shkolnikov et al. 1998 and Plavinski et al. 2003 notethat men with low levels of education were disproportionately affected by the increase inmortality. Data from the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey described below support thisobservation. Over the period 1995 2001, the average annual mortality rate of people aged 3055 was 0.74 percent. The mortality rate ranged from 1.86 percent of those with primaryeducation to 0.23 percent of those with higher education, reflecting a strong educational gradientin mortality Table 1. Sources of Data In the next sections, we assess different explanations for these patterns in mortality. Weuse two sources of data. The first is national data from the 23 countries of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. The mortality data are from the WHO Mortality database andnational statistical yearbooks. We report regression results for mortality among primeage men 5ages 2564, since this is the group where the mortality crisis is most acute. We have alsoexamined mortality rates for women of the same ages. The results are similar so we do not reportthem. 5 See www.euro.who.inthfadb. We use the January 2004 data. 10As with any aggregate regression, it is difficult, if not impossible, to control for all theother causes affecting mortality rates. This is particularly true in a setting like that of the former Soviet Union, where economic and social changes were large and data quality is often poor. Toisolate the theories we consider more concretely, we consider causespecific mortality in additionto total mortality. We group mortality into three broad causes: cardiovascular disease, externalcauses of death homicide, suicide, and accidental death, and all other. Economic and social variables from the same countries are from the WHO Health for All Database 2004, the World Bank 2003, the EBRD Transition Report 2003 and the Trans MONEE database 2003. We discuss specific data series as appropriate below.The second source of data is panel data from the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring SurveyRLMS. The RLMS is a nationally representative panel survey from 1994 2002. The sample 6comprises roughly 4,000 households and 11,000 individuals in each round. The RLMS containsextensive information on income, health status, employment, and demographic characteristics ofindividuals and families, as well as on individual behavior such as smoking and drinking. For families where there is at least one member surviving, the survey asks if anyone diedduring the time period. We are thus able to identify deaths among the vast majority of multipleperson households about 85 percent of the population is in multipleperson households. Ouranalysis of mortality in subsequent sections in based on these multipleperson households. 76 There is an earlier panel component from 1992 to 1994, but we do not use this becauseof the shortness of the panel and concern about data quality in that period. A detailed descriptionof the sampling design and implementation of the RLMS is available at the RLMS website athttp:www.cpc.unc.edurlms. 7 We stack each round of the survey so that each regression uses all rounds of the surveyand includes multiple observations on individuals. Standard errors are clustered by individual tocorrect for these multiple observations. 11Trends in mortality in the RLMS match trends from the aggregate data, although the level ofmortality in the RLMS is 10 20 percent lower than the national data.In our longitudinal data, we control for a number of individual characteristics: age,education, income, year of survey, and region of the country. We also control for past medical 8events such as whether the person ever had a heart attack, was diabetic, or had a stroke.II. Suspect 1: The Acute Medical Care System We start with the most obvious suspect: perhaps the economic changes substantiallydisrupted the medical care system in a way that made medical treatment less effective. One of 9the Soviet Unions most remarkable achievements was the development of a universal healthcare system that extended across the country and provided health care even in the remotest areasof the northern and eastern territories. The system provided the population with a wide range ofmedical services and was particularly successful in reducing deaths due to infectious diseases anddeaths in infancy. The only medical expenditures paid for outofpocket were those forsubsidized prescription drugs and for small nominal payments made to hospital staff to ensure 8 The income control perhaps warrants some comment. In the crosscountry data, we donot control for GDP, since we are interested in the total effect of the variables we examine onmortality, not the partial effect controlling for economic conditions. One could make the sameargument about income in the micro data. We include the income control, however, to pick upthe persons relative position in society. As noted above, relative position is strongly indicativeof mortality, for reasons that may go beyond the specific theories we consider. In practice, ourresults are relatively similar if we include or omit the control for income. For example, thealcohol consumption measure is statistically significant at less than the 5 percent level withnearly identical coefficients whether or not the income control is included in the regression.9 The medical care explanation has been suggested by Ellman 1994. 12better care. Significant payments to doctors on the order of one to twomonths average wagewere reported but were relatively uncommon. 10An obvious candidate to explain the upsurge in mortality in the former Soviet Union isthus a collapse of the health care system during the transition, resulting from the disintegration ofthe USSR and the tremendous budgetary pressures of the early 1990s that led to drastic cutbacksin health care financing in many countries and a vast increase in outofpocket expenditures forpatients. Indeed, the health system seems to have deteriorated since the collapse of the Soviet Union. For example, there are reports that many hospitals and clinics in the former Soviet Unionhave opened feepaying services to compensate for funding shortfalls. Data from the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey indicate a dramatic increase in the number of patients paying forcare in Russia and in the price of that care: in 1992 only 6.2 percent of individuals hospitalizedin the month prior to the survey reported that they paid money for medical care or treatmentwhile in the hospital; of those that paid, the median payment amounted to 34 percent of themedian monthly per capita income. By 1998, 45 percent of respondents indicated that they hadpaid for medical care while in the hospital, and the payment exceeded twothirds of the medianmonthly per capita income Table 2. Anecdotal evidence indicates that, while modern drugs areprescribed for conditions such as cardiovascular disease, many patients cannot afford to purchase That is not to say that the system worked entirely well. The fundamental nature of central 10planning hampered the effectiveness of the health care system in many areas. The developmentof the health care system reflected the overall growth strategy of the country, emphasizingquantity of care growth in indicators such as doctors and hospital beds per capita rather thanquality of care; central planners also set quantitative targets for the number of beds occupied andthe number of procedures performed in hospitals Twigg 1998. Further, there were waits formedical care, as for everything else in the Soviet Union. Knaus 1981 and Ryan 1989 describethe Soviet health care system in the 1970s and 1980s.13them Reiss et al. 1996. Funding difficulties may also have led to a decrease in the capacity andeffectiveness of the health care system itself. Medical care might affect mortality through several channels. Some medical care ispreventive: antihypertension medication reduces the probability of a stroke or heart attack, forexample. Other care is curative, for example hightech treatment of people who have had anadverse event. We consider the acute care setting first, and then return to preventive care.To assess the importance of changes in acute care in explaining the mortality crisis, onewould ideally like to identify whether the increase in death rates was due to an increase in casese.g., an increase in the number of heart attacks, strokes, etc., or to an increase in the fatalityrate; the latter would suggest a particularly large role for declining health care services in themortality crisis. Although data are limited, evidence suggests that the fatality rate changed little during the 1990s. For example, an extensive study of stroke incidence and mortality in Novosibirsklocated in western Siberia and northern Sweden between 1987 and 1994 found that while thecase fatality rate was significantly higher in Novosibirsk 2843 percent than in Sweden 1221percent, case fatality rates remained unchanged over the period in Novosibirsk; the substantialincrease in stroke mortality in Novosibirsk was due to an increase in attacks rather than to higherfatality rates Stegmayr et al. 2000. Indeed, medical care for some types of illnesses apparentlyimproved in Russia in the 1990s: the recent decline in childhood leukemia deaths, for example,is attributed to improvements in care Shkolnikov et al. 1999.To examine this hypothesis further, we employ data from Russia and the other countriesof the former Soviet Union and relate changes in primeage male mortality to the change in thematernal mortality rate death during childbirth. Since maternal mortality is almost entirely 14preventable through medical intervention, the change in the maternal mortality rate is a goodmeasure of the collapse of the medical care system CITE. The maternal mortality rate did notchange appreciably in Russia over the 1990s, rising from 49.0 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1989 to 53.3 deaths in 1995, then falling to 39.7 deaths by 2000.11 This suggests that the capacityof the basic health care system remained essentially unchanged.Using the maternal mortality rate as a proxy for the state of the health care system, thefirst column of Table 3 reports the relation between log changes in prime age male mortality andlog changes in maternal mortality between 1989 and 2000. Our sample consists of the 22countries of the former Soviet bloc for which data are reliable. There is little relation betweenmaternal mortality and male mortality. Indeed, adult male mortality actually fell in countrieswhere maternal mortality rose, though not statistically significantly. We considered other measures of the medical care system as well, focusing more directlyon the availability of medical care resources. The second column relates the change in malemortality to the change in public and private medical spending. Medical spending will changewith both demand and supply, but our hope is that the massive changes in the structure of societyin most former Soviet bloc countries make the supply changes more important over this timeperiod.12 The results are similar; more spending does not lower mortality. Indeed the coefficienton public health expenditures is positively related to the male primeage death rate, indicatingthat reverse causality may be an issue. In any case, there is little evidence to support the 11Note that the maternal mortality in rate is high compared with that of the U.S., wherethe maternal mortality rate in 2000 was 9.8 per 100,000 live births. 12 We have also experimented with direct quantity measures, including the number ofhospital beds per capita and the number of doctors per capita, with similar results.15hypothesis that a breakdown in the acute health care system is a primary cause of the mortalitycrisis.The situation with preventive medications is more difficult to assess. The Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey indicates whether the person takes any medication, but not thetype of medication. Still, use of any medication did not decline in Russia. In both 1993 and 2000, about 38 percent of Russian adults reported taking any medication. As noted below, this isconsistent with evidence that traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease did not change.III. Suspect 2: Traditional Risk Factors for Cardiovascular Disease The finding that the case fatality rate for cardiovascular disease did not increase indicatesthat there was an increase in the incidence of serious cardiovascular disease. One thus movesnaturally to risk factors for cardiovascular illness. Five traditional risk factors for cardiovasculardisease have been identified in the western literature: hypertension or high blood pressure, highcholesterol, diabetes, obesity, and smoking. Obesity The RLMS collects data on BMI, which we examine over the time period.13 Figure 6shows trends in the share of the population who are overweight or obese in Russia over the 1993 2000 period for primeage adults.14 From 1993 to 2000, obesity increased slightly for both men 13 In addition to its direct importance, obesity is related to high blood pressure, highcholesterol, and diabetes. 14 The categories in Figure 6 are based on the following WHO definitions: overweight if Body Mass Index weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared is greater than 25and less than 29.9; obese if BMI is 30 or higher. Data from the Russian Longitudinal Mortality Survey suggest that mortality begins to increase after BMI reaches 31 for men see Table 4.16and women, apparently due to a shift from the overweight category into obesity.15 At the sametime, the RLMS also indicates little change in the share of people who are underweight over theperiod, suggesting that diminished ability to purchase the calories required for adequate nutritionis not the explanation for the mortality crisis.16The RLMS data allow one to estimate the relation between weight and mortality in Russia. The first column of Table 4 reports odds ratios for death among men in the RLMSdata.17,18 There is a Ushaped relation between BMI and mortality risk, as is found in westerncountries as well. But the very slight change in obesity predicts only minor changes in mortalityrisk: the BMI change over the 1990s predicts an increase in mortality rates of only .02 percent,suggesting that obesity can be ruled out as a primary cause of the mortality crisis. Tobacco 15Note that the level of obesity among Russian men is much lower than that in the United States: in 2000, 12 percent of Russian men age 2564 were obese, compared with 25 percent of U.S. men in 2001 Statistical Abstract of the United States, 2003. For women, 28.5 percent of Russian women were obese compared with 24.7 percent of U.S. women.16 Other studies have corroborated the finding that overall nutritional status in Russia isremarkably resilient to the extreme fluctuations in household income that families haveexperienced in the last decade Dore, Adair and Popkin 2003; Thomas and Stillman 2004.17 The Appendix reports similar regressions for women. The findings are qualitativelyand quantitatively similar. 18The interpretation of odds ratios is as follows: for a dummy variable such as poorhealth in Table 4, an odds ratio of 1.91 indicates that the odds of dying are 91 percent greaterwhen the individual is in poor health than if not. For continuous variables, such as the odds ratioof 1.06 on age, the odds of dying increase by 6 percent for each yearly increase in age.17Smoking is associated with higher rates of cardiovascular disease, along with manycancers.19 Russians men smoke much more than European men the ratio is about 2 to 1. Russian women smoke less than their European counterparts, despite the higher rate ofcirculatory disease deaths. However, while high levels of smoking among men may partlyexplain the high level of cardiovascular mortality in Russia, changes in smoking rates seemunlikely to explain the sharp increase in cardiovascular mortality rates in the early 1990s. Use oftobacco products did not increase greatly in Russia over the 1990s.20 As Figure 7 shows, theshare of adult males who report smoking cigarettes every day was flat at about 60 percent, andthe share of women who smoke increased only moderately.21 We thus attach little importance tothe smoking explanation.Hypertension, High Cholesterol, and Diabetes Data on other cardiovascular disease risk factors in countries of the former Soviet Unionare difficult to obtain. Even in western countries, precise data on the prevalence of elevated risk 19 Data from the Russian Longitudinal Mortality Survey, reported in Tables 4 and Appendix Table 1, confirm this finding: smoking increases the odds of dying by 60 percent formen and by nearly 3 times for women compared with nonsmokers. A study of death certificatesin Udmurtia in the Urals also confirmed that higher rates of smoking significantly increase theodds of dying from cardiovascular disease Shkolnikov et al. 2001b. 20 Smokingrelated deaths almost certainly evolve over the long periods of time; thewestern literature suggests a 20 to 25 year lag between smoking trends and mortality ???. Butlung cancer death rates in Russia have fallen sharply since the early 1990s, suggesting thecardiovascular disease mortality increase is not a result of a longterm response to smokingtrends Shkolnikov et al. 1999.21 The Novosibirsk study reached similar conclusions. Smoking rates among Novosibirskmen are far higher than those of Swedish men 56 percent versus 21 percent daily smokers,respectively, but this rate remained stable over time. Among women, the smoking rate in Novosibirsk doubled, from 3 percent to 6 percent, but remained much lower than the Swedishlevel of 28 percent Stegmayr et al. 2000.18are sparse, since most people with moderately elevated risk are asymptomatic, and thus may notmake their way into the medical system. Still, the evidence that we have suggests that thesetraditional risk factors did not change materially, and indeed that they are no higher in Russia andthe Baltics than in western populations. For example, the Novosibirsk stroke study found notonly that many stroke risk factors were lower in the Novosibirsk population than in the Swedishpopulation, but that these risk factors remained stable or even improved in the Novosibirskpopulation over the period Stegmayr et al. 2000.22 Epidemiological studies of cardiovascularrisk factors in the Baltic countries also find few differences in traditional risk factors betweenthese and western populations, as well as mildly favorable trends in these risk factors throughoutthe 1990s Kristenson et al. 1997; Volozh et al. 2002; Domarkiene 1993.Summary The surprising finding from these data is that traditional risk factors explain relativelylittle of the increase in mortality in Russia. This leads us, as it has others, to consider nontraditional risk factors for mortality.IV. Suspect 3: Alcohol The risk factor that has drawn the most attention in possibly explaining Russias mortalitycrisis is alcohol. Alcohol consumption can affect mortality in many ways. Alcohol is a direct 22 For example, total cholesterol levels were lower in the Novosibirsk population than in Sweden, and while these levels declined in both populations over the period, the decline in Novosibirsk exceeded that in Sweden. There is a higher prevalence of hypertension among the Russian population than the Swedish population, but again this prevalence decreased in Novosibirsk significantly from 1987 through 1994 while stroke attack incidence in Novosibirskincreased by more than 50 percent over these years.19cause of many accidental deaths. In addition, some recent evidence suggests that heavy alcoholconsumption especially binge drinking could have lead to increased cardiovascular diseasemortality. Alcohol consumption is slightly lower in Russia than in Europe,23 but the composition ofalcohol consumed differs markedly. Compared to their European counterparts, Russiansconsume a great deal more alcohol in the form of spirits rather than as beer or wine Figure 8. Inaddition, alcohol consumption in Russia is much more likely to be binge drinking than in Europe 120 grams or more of hard alcohol per occasion.24 While moderate alcohol may begood for health, binge drinking could well be harmful.Figure 9 shows the trend in annual consumption of alcohol in liters of pure alcohol peryear from two sources: the official data from the WHO, and tabulations from the RLMS.25 The WHO data have the advantage of being present for all countries, but they have a potentiallymajor drawback in being based on official alcohol sales. Many former Soviet countriesexperienced a flood of imports in the early 1990s, and these imports are believed to be omittedfrom the official measure of alcohol consumption.26 Alcohol consumption in the RLMS may 23For example, according to the WHO data, per capita consumption of pure alcohol in Russia was 10.8 liters per capita, compared with 11.1 liters per capita in the European Union in 2000.24This definition is based on the epidemiological literature Malyutina et al. 2001;Malyutina et al. 2002. We also defined a second binge drinking measure based on 160 or moregrams of alcohol per day; the results were nearly identical to those reported here and are omittedfor brevity.25 The RLMS asks individuals whether they drank in the last 30 days, and if so, how manygrams of various types of alcohol they usually consumed in a day. Total alcohol consumption isobtained by converting grams of beer, wine, vodka etc. into grams of pure alcohol based on thealcohol content of each. 26Russias official measure of alcohol consumption does include estimates of unrecordedconsumption. In addition, alcohol consumption data on Kazakhstan appear to be substantially in 20also be underestimated if individuals fail to report their alcohol consumption completely. Forcomparison purposes, the graph also shows the prime age male death rate.Both surveys show a substantial increase in alcohol consumption in the early 1990s onthe order of 25 30 percent between 1992 and 1994. The increase in alcohol consumption in theearly 1990s is consistent with a substantial reduction in price: the relative price of alcohol fell by 58 percent between December 1990 and December 1994. Using the WHO data, the change inalcohol consumption and the price of alcohol between 1990 and 1994 implies a price elasticity ofdemand for alcohol of .36, which seems plausible. Increased alcohol consumption may also berelated to the increased political and economic uncertainty in Russia in the early 1990s as thetransition to a market economy began in earnest. Both surveys also show a reduction in alcoholconsumption between 1994 and 1996; this corresponds to a relative increase in alcohol prices. The RLMS and WHO data show a different trend after 1996, with alcohol consumptiondecreasing substantially in the RLMS until 1998 and then increasing thereafter. The WHO datashow a smooth increase over most of the period. Over the entire 1992 2000 time period,alcohol consumption increased in Russia by between 27 percent using the RLMS data and 63percent using the WHO data.The RLMS data in particular track closely the changes in the male standardized death rateover time: alcohol consumption increased, and so did mortality. The Appendix shows alcoholconsumption for other Soviet bloc countries. Alcohol consumption increased significantly insome of the mortality belt countries in the early 1990s in particular, in Lithuania, Moldovaand Russia while it changed little or declined in the countries of Central and Southern Europe. This too is suggestive of an alcoholbased explanation for the mortality crisis.error, so we omit that country from this part of the analysis.21Alcohol and Violent Deaths One clear case where alcohol may affect mortality is through violent death. Accidentalalcohol poisoning represents 7 percent of the increase in male mortality between 1989 and 1994,and 6 percent of the increase in female mortality. In addition, alcohol may play some role inother violent deaths as well, either by instigating murder or suicide, or as a disguised cause ofthem. The crosscountry data help shed light on the importance of alcohol in death fromexternal causes. The first column of Table 5 shows the relation between changes in alcoholconsumption and changes in death from external causes. The coefficient on alcohol consumptionis positive, but not statistically significant. Still, the coefficient is large; the 45 percent increasein alcohol consumption in Russia between 1989 and 2000 using the WHO data is predicted toaccount for 34 percent of the increase in all external causes of death. 27For 2000 2002 the RLMS also provides information on causes of death; we exploitthese data to investigate the relation between alcohol consumption and accidental deaths. Because the sample size and number of deaths over this period is limited, we restrict the analysisto men only. The first three columns of Table 6 report logistic models for the probability ofaccidental death in the RLMS. Alcohol consumption is positively and significantly related toaccidental deaths, as shown in column 1. As column 2 shows, this is particularly related tobinge drinking. Men who binge drink are nearly four times more likely to die of accidentaldeaths than are people who do not drink. Comparing the coefficients from the RLMS regressions 27This figure is calculated by multiplying the coefficient on alcohol consumption by thelog change in alcohol consumption in Russia over this period .432 x .450 .194, and dividingby the log change in external cause mortality in Russia .194.565 .34. The contributions ofother factors to the increase in death rates in Russia based on the crosscountry regressions,discussed below, are calculated similarly.22with those of the crosscountry regressions, the former indicate that the increase in alcoholconsumption in Russia between 1989 and 2000 as measured by the WHO data accounts forapproximately 8 percent of the increase in accidental deaths among primeage men during thisperiod; the latter indicates that alcohol consumption accounts for 34 percent of the increase inaccidental deaths. 28Alcohol and Cardiovascular Disease While studies show that moderate alcohol consumption has favorable effects on health,some evidence suggests that binge drinking may be harmful to cardiovascular health. Mc Keeand Britton 1998 review the epidemiological literature on the relationship between alcoholconsumption and cardiovascular mortality and conclude that there is a physiological mechanismfor a relationship between alcohol consumption, particularly binge drinking, and increased risk ofdeath due to cardiovascular disease.29 Arrhythmias and heart attacks seem particularly related tobinge drinking. A small casecontrol study of adult male deaths in Udmurtia confirmed thatcardiovascular deaths are strongly associated with heavy drinking Shkolnikov et al. 2001b. Further, the number of cardiovascular deaths among men in Russia in 1993 1995 wassignificantly higher on Saturdays, Sundays, and Mondays than on other days of the week, whichthe authors argue is likely due to increased alcohol consumption on weekends Chenet et al.1998. 28Because the coefficients on the logistic regressions are not directly comparable withthose of the crosscountry regressions, we reestimate the RLMS regressions as linear probabilitymodels in order to calculate the contribution of each coefficient to the probability of dying.29 This mechanism operates through the increased risk of thrombosis and hemorrhagicstroke which result from excessive alcohol consumption, as well as through the reducedprotective actions of HDL good cholesterol which occur with heavy drinking. 23Other researchers, however, have disputed the claim that Russias high cardiovascularmortality is due to excessive alcohol consumption. Bobak and Marmot 1999 point out that thesimilar relative increase in mortality among men and women in Russia is inconsistent with analcoholbased explanation, since Russian women drink far less than Russian men. A similarconclusion comes from looking across regions of the former Soviet Union. Among the former Soviet bloc countries are Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, both Muslim countries where reportedalcohol consumption is low, particularly consumption of spirits: per capita consumption ofspirits was .02 and .01 liters of pure alcohol, respectively, in Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan in 2000, and total alcohol consumption was onetenth the Russian level. Still, cardiovasculardisease mortality in these countries rose by 23 and 25 percent respectively between 1989 and 1994. Bobak and Marmot also show that the alcohol effect would have to be much greater toexplain the increase in cardiovascular disease mortality: not only would the prevalence of heavydrinking have had to have increased from 20 to 50 percent of the population, but the harmfuleffects of alcohol consumption i.e. the relative risk would have had to have more than doubledas well, which seems implausible.In addition, a study of men aged 2564 living in Novosibirsk who were followed between 1985 and 1994 found a higher risk of cardiovascular disease death in a small group of frequentheavy drinkers, but not among binge drinkers Malyutina et al. 2002. Since frequent heavydrinkers defined as drinking at least 120 gram of ethanol per occasion at least three times perweek make up only 5 percent of all drinkers and 4 percent of all Russian men, this studyconcluded that alcohol is unlikely to provide the sole explanation for the increase in mortality in Russia; the authors estimate that even if the rates of frequent heavy drinking are five times higher 24than estimated based on surveys, it is still the case that alcohol consumption can explain at most 8 percent of deaths from cardiovascular disease. Finally, the authors of a study of cholesterollevels in St. Petersburg argue that the substantial decline in HDL good cholesterol levelsobserved among the population in the 1990s contradicts an alcoholbased explanation for the Russian mortality, since regular consumption of alcohol raises the level of HDL cholesterolPlavinski et al. 1999.Both our crosscountry and longitudinal data provide evidence on the link betweenalcohol consumption and cardiovascular disease mortality. The second column of Table 5 showsthe impact of alcohol consumption on cardiovascular deaths using the crosscountry sample. Thecoefficient is positive, but not statistically significant p value .122. The magnitude isrelatively large, however. An increase in alcohol consumption like that seen in Russia wouldincrease cardiovascular disease mortality by 10 percent. The micro data from the RLMS Table 6 suggest no impact of alcohol consumption oncardiovascular mortality, even from binge drinking. The coefficient on alcohol consumptionsuggests a slight protective effect of drinking for cardiovascular health, but is not statisticallysignificant.Total Effect The total effect of alcohol consumption on mortality in the international data is shown in Table 3. In the crosscountry data, alcohol consumption has a positive, statistically significanteffect on total mortality. The coefficient is large: it implies that the increase in alcoholconsumption in Russia explains about 25 percent of the increase in mortality in Russia between 1989 and 2000.25The RLMS data also suggests an effect of alcohol consumption on mortality. The secondcolumn of Table 4 adds a measure of alcohol consumption to the regression in the first column. Alcohol is positively and statistically significantly associated with mortality.30 Using thecoefficient on alcohol consumption from a linear probability estimate of this model, an increasein alcohol of the magnitude seen in Russia over 1989 2000 is predicted to increase mortality by 12.6 percent, or 22.3 percent of the total increase in mortality. The estimates from the micro andmacro data are thus consistent:31 in total, about onequarter of the increase in Russia stems fromthe increase in alcohol consumption over the 1990s.V. Suspect 4: The Composition of the Diet While weight has fluctuated little in Russia over the course of the transition, Russianhouseholds have responded to the income shocks by shifting the composition of their dietstowards cheaper foods. This dietary shift may be one of the causes of the increase andsubsequent decrease in cardiovascular mortality among the population.The Russian diet has long been low in fruit and vegetable content, due to the difficulty ofgrowing such foods in the Russian climate and the priority placed by the countrys leadership,beginning with Khrushchev, on increasing the consumption of meat and dairy products. As aresult, research has shown that severe antioxidant deficiencies exist in some Russian 30 In other results not shown, we have divided alcohol into different types. Vodka andsamogon homemade alcohol seem to be most harmful to health, while wine consumptionappears to be protective. 31 In the micro data, there does not seem to be a particular harm from binge drinking,although the measurement of binge drinking may be somewhat problematic.26populations.32 Although fruits and vegetables became much more widely available in Russia asmarket reforms were implemented in the early 1990s, consumption of these goods remainedextremely low in comparison with western countries and declined sharply during the first half ofthe decade: average per capita consumption of vegetables in Russia fell from 85 kilograms peryear in 1990 75 percent of the US level to 71 kilograms in 1994 Figure 10. Consumptionincreased as incomes stabilized after 1994, then fell sharply again following the 1998 financialcrisis. As is evident from Figure 10, the changes in vegetable consumption closely track theerratic changes in male life expectancy in Russia. Meat consumption is also much lower in Russia than in the west, and was declining overthe time period, from 60 percent of the US level in 1990 to 40 percent in 1997. Meat may have apositive or negative effect on health, especially the fatty meats commonly consumed in Russia.While research on the impact of diet on health is not complete, some research suggeststhat the composition of the diet may be an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Ginter 1995, 1997 argues that antioxidant deficiency, stemming from the low level of fruit andvegetable consumption in the former Soviet Union, may play an important role in thedevelopment of cardiovascular disease, in particular that such a deficiency may interact withother conditions in society such as pollution, alcohol consumption, and smoking to promotecardiovascular disease development. At least two recent studies suggest that these dietaryimbalances may translate into heightened risk for cardiovascular disease in the former Sovietpopulation. A study of 50year old Lithuanian and Swedish men conducted in 1993199432 For example a 1992 study found that 93 percent of men living in Karelia, Russia hadsevere vitamin C deficiency, as compared with 2 percent of Finnish men in a neighboring regionMatilainen et al. 1996. 27showed that plasma concentrations of antioxidant vitamins were lower in the Lithuanian menthan Swedish men, and that the Lithuanian men had a strikingly reduced resistance of LDLbad cholesterol to oxidation. The authors argue that antioxidant deficiency likely contributesto the much higher mortality rates from coronary heart disease among Lithuanian men comparedwith Swedish men Kristenson et al. 1997. A separate study of St. Petersburg residents showeda dramatic increase in the number of men with dangerously low levels of HDL cholesterol in the 1990s: in 19861988 6 percent of St. Petersburg men age 40 to 49 had low levels of HDLcholesterol; by 19951997 36.4 percent of men in this age group had low levels of HDLcholesterol. The decline in HDL cholesterol levels was similar across all men in the 20 to 69 agegroup, and for women as well Plavinski et al. 1999. Dietary change may also be one of the few factors that can explain in part the widelydivergent patterns of mortality across Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Severalstudies attribute the dramatic decrease in cardiovascular mortality in Eastern Europe to thechanges in diet that occurred following price liberalization Bobak et al. 1997; Poledne and Skodova 2000; Witold et al. 1998. In many countries, the prices of meat and dairy productswere heavily subsidized, and the availability of fruits and vegetables was limited. Priceliberalization, the removal of subsidies, and an increase in food imports led to a dramaticreduction in the relative price of fruits and vegetables, and a significant increase in theirconsumption. Combined with the relative increase in the price of meat and dairy products, thesechanges led to a substantial improvement in the ratio of vegetable to animal fats consumedamong these populations.3333 For example, in the Czech Republic, the average per capita consumption of butter fellfrom 9.4 kg in 1989 to 5.4 kg in 1992 Bobak et al. 1997, while consumption of fruit andvegetables increased from 68 to 87 kg between 1989 and 1997 Poledne and Skodova 2000. In Poland, consumption of animal fat fell from 101 to 77 grams per day between 1989 and 1994,28We examine the importance of the dietary change hypothesis using the international data.The WHO Health for All database estimates average fruit and vegetable availability per personper year in kilograms. For many countries in the former Soviet Union, these data are availableonly beginning in 1992, so the change for some countries is over the 1992 2000 period. Boththe levels and changes in fruit and vegetable consumption differ markedly across countries andover time: In Russia, for example, average fruit and vegetable consumption fell from 121 to 105kilograms per capita between 1992 and 1994, then rose to 114 kilograms by 1998; in contrast, in Slovenia the average consumption rose from 117 to 188 kilograms per capita between 1992 and 1998. The results are presented in the fourth column of Table 3. The coefficient on fruit andvegetable consumption is negative as expected, but is statistically significant at only the 16percent level. Even taken at face value, however, the impact of changes in the composition ofthe diet is small. Fruit and vegetable consumption in Russia fell by less than 4 percent over theentire time period. The implied change in mortality is less than 3 percent of the change in overallprimeage male mortality between 1992 and 2000. As with alcohol consumption, we are interested in how fruit and vegetable consumptionaffects particular causes of death. Table 5 shows that increased fruit and vegetable consumptionis statistically significantly negatively associated with cardiovascular disease mortality, as thetheory suggests. Still, the coefficient implies that changes in fruit and vegetable consumptionexplain only 2 percent of the increase in cardiovascular mortality among Russian men over thisperiod. While fruit and vegetable consumption cannot explain the increase in Russian mortalityover the entire time period, it might well be a factor in the initial effect of transition. Over thewhile consumption of vegetable fat increased from 28 to 40 grams per day Sekula et al. 1997.29199294 period, the decline in fruit and vegetable consumption in Russia can explain 28 percentof the increase in cardiovascular disease mortality. And as noted above, the change in diet is adistinguishing factor between Russia and Eastern Europe. If fruit and vegetable consumption in Russia had mirrored that in Slovenia between 1992 and 2000, our regressions suggest that Russian mortality would have fallen by nearly 10 percent over the 1990s, narrowing the primeage male mortality gap with eastern Europe by nearly 50 percent. 34Unfortunately, we cannot examine the dietary composition theory using the RLMS data. While the RLMS asks respondents to provide detailed information on the type and quantity offood consumed in the previous 24 hours, these data have not yet been released for public use.On the basis of the aggregate data, we conclude that changes in the composition of the dietcannot explain the absolute increases in mortality in Russia, but helps explain some of thedivergence with other eastern European countries.VI. Suspect 5: Material Deprivation The transition from communism led to a significant devaluation of human capital. In Russia, for example, the wages of men with 30 or more years of work experience actually fellbelow the wages of new entrants to the work force Brainerd 1998. Coupled with this is a veryweak government safety net weaker in Russia than in many other mortality belt countries. Russia, for example, lacks a national meanstested benefit program for families living below the 34While dietary change may gradually affect health, the evidence described above for Eastern Europe suggests that the effects of decreased fat consumption and increased fruit andvegetable consumption may lead to a rapid decline in cardiovascular disease Zatonski et al.1998; Poledne and Skodova 2000. This is also consistent with the rapid decline incardiovascular disease mortality in Germanoccupied Norway during World War II, coincidentwith the dramatic enforced decline in meat and dairy consumption in the country during thoseyears Zatonski et al. 1998.30poverty line. One hypothesis for increased mortality is thus that severe economic hardshipincreased, and this led to increased mortality Lynch et al., 2000.We noted above that the share of the Russian population that is underweight did notchange over the time period, but this is only one measure of material deprivation. It may be, forexample, that people kept up caloric intake but cut back on energy in winter or did more manuallabor at home. Our RLMS data allow us to examine the effect of additional aspects of materialdeprivation on mortality. The fifth column of Table 4 includes various measures of hardship inthe mortality regressions whether the family is in poverty or extreme poverty;35 whether thefamily received subsidies for fuel; whether the family had to sell goods to obtain money for food;and the share of total household expenditures on food. All of these variables are statisticallyinsignificant in these regressions and many of the coefficients are small in magnitude. Theseresults thus suggest that material deprivation is unlikely to explain the upsurge in mortality in Russia and the other former Soviet republics.VII. Suspect 6: The Stress of Transition Before 1989, Russians lived in a country that provided complete economic security: unemployment was virtually unknown, pensions were guaranteed and provided an adequatestandard of living, and macroeconomic instability had never affected the average citizen. Theeconomic reforms implemented in 1992 created an upheaval in the country that, while beneficial 35The poverty measure is based on the official Russian poverty measure, which in turnuses a representative subsistence food basket and a food to total expenditure multiplier todetermine the poverty line. A household is in extreme poverty if its income is less than half ofthe poverty line.31in many ways, changed the life course of virtually every citizen in the country. For the first time,the average Russian confronted a completely unpredictable future.Unpredictability is an example of a psychosocial factor that may influence health. Thelink between stress and health is the most explored factor. Stress arises when an individualperceives a discrepancy between the demands of a situation and the physical or psychologicalcapacity to respond to those demands Shapiro 1995. A high level of stress is related to thedevelopment of cardiovascular disease even independent of its effect on dietary and lifestylefactors although the physiological mechanisms for the link between stress and cardiovasculardisease remain unclear Labarthe 1998; Sapolsky, 1998. Other psychosocial factors may affect health as well. Greater despair or hopelessnessamong middleaged men is associated with higher risk of heart disease and heart attack, as wellas earlier onset of artery disease, even controlling for risk factors such as alcohol consumptionand smoking Everson et al. 1997.36 People who have more social support are similarly likelyto have improved outcomes over those with less support Berkman et al., 1992.A number of indicators suggest increased psychosocial problems in the former Soviet Union, especially Russia. As noted above, suicide rates rose dramatically in the early years oftransition, particularly among middleaged men. By 1994, in fact, the suicide rate for Russianmen aged 5054 was over six times higher than that in the U.S. 139 and 22.5 deaths per 100,000population, respectively. In contrast, suicide rates remained constant or fell in Eastern Europe;in Hungary, for example a country with one of the highest suicide rates in the region 36 Increased stress may also induce behavior with adverse health consequences, such asreckless driving and increased alcohol consumption. These effects are captured in our previousanalysis.32historically the suicide rate for men aged 2564 fell from 84.4 per 100,000 population in 1989to 65.0 in 1995.Russians also tend to have more negative expectations about the future than do their East European counterparts. The Central and East European Barometer CEEB program hasconducted surveys of Russia and Eastern European countries beginning in the early 1990s andending in 1996. Among the questions asked is one about expectations of future financialcircumstances: Over the next twelve months, do you expect that the financial situation of yourhousehold will: 1 get a lot better; 2 get a little better; 3 stay the same; 4 get a little worse;5 get a lot worse. The average in Russia is nearly 3.5, among the highest on the list and farmore pessimistic than the more successful East European countries such as the Czech Republicand Slovenia Figure 11.Cross section data also suggest that expectations about the future may play a role inmortality increases. Figure 12 shows that primeage people are the most pessimistic age group in Russia, even more so than the elderly. To examine the role of psychosocial factors in explaining health in Russia, we relatemortality rates across countries to suicide rates. Figure 13 shows the relation between changes insuicide and overall mortality less death from suicide, and Table 3 shows the regression. Themale suicide rate is positively and significantly correlated with the change in the overall deathrate. The coefficient is reasonably large; this proxy for stress explains nearly onequarter of the 33increase in mortality in Russia over the time period.37 As Table 5 shows, suicide is significantlycorrelated with other external causes of death,38 but not cardiovascular disease mortality. Understanding which factors lie behind this relation is more difficult, since we can onlytest some theories. As noted above, diminished expectations about the future is one possiblemechanism. Figure 14 shows some tendency for countries with a worsening of expectationsabout the future to have worse outcomes, though this relationship is not statistically significantfor allcause mortality Table 3. Poor expectations is a somewhat more significant predictor ofdeath from external causes Table 5; pvalue.11. The RLMS data show a similar relation. The RLMS asks people: Do you think that inthe next twelve months your family will live better than today, or worse? Answers range frommuch better 1 to much worse 5. We define an indicator of positive expectations whichis equal to one if the individual answered 1 or 2 will live somewhat better to this question. The sixth column of Table 4 shows that the odds of dying are 30 percent lower for men who havepositive expectations about the future the coefficient is significant at the 11.3 percent level; forwomen the odds of dying are 50 percent lower reported in the Appendix table. Note that thiseffect is found controlling for income; this is not a finding that the poor are more likely to diethan the rich, rather that those with lower expectations are in worse health, even given theirincome.37 Suicide is a part of total mortality, but the impact here is substantially greater than justthe direct effect. The direct effect is about 4.5 percent of the mortality increase for men and 1percent for women, as shown in Figure 5.38Note that the dependent variable in this regression is calculated as death rate due toexternal causes minus the death rate due to suicide, so that the relationship between suicide andexternal causes of death is not a mechanical one.34While the data show clearly that expectations are important for health, the regressions arealso clear that changes in outlook for the future cannot be the whole explanation for the increasein mortality in Russia. Figure 15 shows the trend in expectations in Russia using the CEEB datathrough 1996, and similar data from the RLMS from 1994 to 2002. There was surprisingly littlechange in future expectations in the early years of transition in Russia. Expectations improvedslightly through 1993, and then returned to their prior level. Expectations got worse in thefinancial crisis of 1998, but after that, expectations improved substantially. This is at the sametime that mortality rates in Russia were increasing; in particular, male life expectancy at birth fellfrom 61.3 years in 1998 to 58.5 years by 2002. Thus, the time series of the change inexpectations about the future does not match the time series of the change in mortality. 39Psychosocial distress may be related not to average expectations about the future, but tothe fear of very bad outcomes. Uncertainty associated with the possibility of becoming very poormay create stress sufficient to result in harm to health. To test this hypothesis, we use data on thechange in the minimum wage as a percentage of the average wage across countries for thecountrylevel regressions and across Russias regions for the individual data. We choose theminimum wage as our measure of poor outcomes for several reasons. Besides its direct effect onwages, many countries use the minimum wage as a base for setting the level of other socialbenefits such as child care allowances and student stipends. And while other measures ofgovernment support such as the level of unemployment benefits or government spending onsocial benefits may be preferable, consistent measures of these variables across countries oracross Russias regions are not available. 39 There might, of course, be a lagged effect of expectations on health, but our data are notrefined enough to permit such an analysis.35Minimum wages have changed dramatically in many transition countries over the 1990s. For example, the minimum wage in the Soviet Union was 30 35 percent of the average wage inthe late 1980s; it fell to less than 6 percent of the average wage in Russia by 2000. Moreover,throughout much of the 1990s the minimum wage in Russia was far below the subsistenceminimum calculated by the government for determining poverty rates. For example, in 1996 theminimum wage was 75,900 rubles per month, while the average subsistence minimum whichvaries by region and demographic group was approximately 375,000 rubles per month. Incontrast, many of the East European countries maintained a relatively high minimum wagethroughout the 1990s, for example exceeding 34 percent in Poland and 42 percent in Hungary in 2001. Table 3 shows that the log change in the minimum wage as a share of the average wage isnegatively and significantly related to the change in mortality for all causes. It is also stronglynegatively related to the increase in cardiovascular disease deaths Table 5. The coefficient onminimum wages in the all causes regression indicates that the reduction in the minimum wagecan explain 34 percent of the increase in deaths in Russia over the 1989 2000 period. The last column of Table 4 shows analogous regressions using the RLMS micro data. The minimum wage is statistically insignificant in the RLMS regressions for all causes, but,consistent with the crosscountry evidence, is statistically significant at the 7.8 percent level forcardiovascular disease deaths and is insignificant for external cause deaths Table 6. Thecoefficient on the minimum wage for cardiovascular disease deaths is large; in linear probabilityform, the change in the minimum wage can explain 98 percent of the increase in malecardiovascular disease deaths in Russia, or roughly 40 percent of the increase in all male deathsin the country.36Recall that the minimum wage is not a proxy for poor individual circumstances. Directmeasures of material deprivation such as poverty and having enough food do not predictmortality. Rather, mortality appears to be associated with the prospect of suffering a substantialreduction in income, and hence living standards.Both our micro and macro data thus show clear impacts of psychosocial factors onmortality. Our estimate is that psychosocial factors as a whole explain about onequarter of theincrease in Russia over the 1990s. In looking at particular causes, the data are most consistentwith the idea that the tattering of the social safety net combined with great economic dislocationhave led to significant stress, and attendant poor outcomes. The exact mechanism linking thesefactors, however, remains to be explored. VIII. Conclusions Our analysis of mortality in Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union leadsus to highlight two significant causes of the mortality crisis. The first cause is increased alcoholconsumption. Our results in the crosscountry and micro data are fairly consistent; in each case,about a quarter of the increase in mortality in Russia is due to increased alcohol use. Much ofthis alcohol use is a reflection of the lower price of alcohol over time, though factors such as theloosening of the Gorbachevera restrictions on alcohol availability almost certainly played a roleas well. Increased stress from the transition to a market economy also seems to play a role in Russias mortality crisis. The second factor is psychosocial stress, likely brought on by thesubstantial changes in the economic environment and a material reduction in the social safety net. We have a range of estimates of the impact of psychosocial distress on mortality, but a best guessis perhaps that it can explain one quarter of the increase in mortality.37Other theories find little support in our data. We find no evidence that a reduction in theeffectiveness of the medical care system is related to increased mortality. Nor do we findevidence that a change in the composition of the diet is related to increases in Russian mortality,though more favorable dietary changes in Eastern Europe seem to explain some of the gooddemographic news enjoyed by those countries.The major remaining question is how to explain the approximately half of the mortalityreduction that is unaccounted for by the factors we identify. It is, of course, possible that thefactors we identify are the right ones, and that the uncertainty encompasses the full mortalitychange. Alternatively, there may be factors beyond what we have considered that are importantin the Russian mortality crisis. Analysis of such factors will have to await the future.38References Anderson, Barbara A. and Brian D.
