IZA Discussion Paper No. 3731 September 2008 ABSTRACT The Farm, the City, and the Emergence of Social Security In this paper we study the social, demographic and economic origins of social security. The data for the U.S. and for a cross section of countries make it clear that urbanization and industrialization are strongly associated with the rise of social insurance. We describe a model economy in which demographics, technology, and social security are linked together. We study an economy with two locations sectors, the farm agricultural and the city industrial. The decision to migrate from rural to urban locations is endogenous and linked to productivity differences between the two locations and survival probabilities. Furthermore, the level of social security is determined by majority voting. We show that a calibrated version of this economy is consistent with the historical transformation in the United States. Initially a majority of voters live on the farm and do not want to implement social security. Once a majority of the voters move to the city, the median voter prefers a positive social security tax. In the model social security emerges and is sustained over time as a political and economic equilibrium. Modeling the political economy of social security within a model of structural change leads to a rich economic environment in which the median voter is identified by both age and location.

By 1940 the share of population living in rural areas was only 43.5%, while the share livingon the farm was only 23%. Coincident with this immense shift in the structure of theeconomy came changes in the institutional needs of the population. The sorts of social carearrangements that were common place on the farm were harder to implement and enforcein the city, and the shifting population gave rise to new political coalitions with disparateviews on social policy. Many prominent accounts of changing institutions of this period,e.g. Wiebe 1967, Sass 1997 and Schieber and Shoven 1999, emphasize the critical rolethat urbanization and industrialization played in the creation of new institutions: cid:147Thewillingness of the U.S. to cid:133nally go the route of so many other countries in adopting anational social insurance program in 1935 was the result of three major forces. The cid:133rst wasthe increased dependence on wage income that had arisen over the preceding halfcenturyas the country had industrialized,cid:148Schieber and Shoven 1999, page 17. Indeed, the Social Security Administration 2003 characterizes the year 1920 as cid:147a historical tippingpoint. Inthat year, for the cid:133rst time in our nationcid:146s history, more people were living in cities than onfarms.cid:148In this paper, we propose that the rural agricultural to urban industrial shift is onepossible explanation for the emergence of social insurance, more specicid:133cally, social security.There is a signicid:133cant literature on the political economy of social security systems that analyzes the political sustainability of Payasyougo PAYG social security.2 The conclusion 1 Appendix A provides data sources for all cid:133gures.2 There also exists a large literature that analyzes macroeconomic and distributional implications of thecurrent social security system without political economy considerations e.g. Imrohoroglu, Imrohoroglu and Joines 1985.1of most of this literature is that support for social security in democratic societies dependson the age of the median voter.3 These papers are oriented toward explaining why an existing system can survive, expand or shrink.4 They cannot address why such a system wasstarted in the cid:133rst place, or more precisely, why such systems have not always existed.5 Byallowing the identity of the median voter to include his geographical location, we overcomethis shortcoming and provide a framework in which the emergence of social security is aresponse to the urbanization of the population.The eects of urbanization and industrialization on social insurance has long been recognized by political scientists and sociologists. What are referred to as the prerequisites andthe logic of industrialism explanations of the emergence of social security give prominentroles to urbanization and industrialization. According to Collier and Messick 1975, page 1303, cid:147The prerequisites approach treats the development of social security as a resultof the social and economic transformations associated with the transition from primarilyagricultural to industrial economies. Within this perspective, one of the most importanthypotheses is that the decline in the proportion of the workforce in agriculture increases theneed for social securitycid:148.6Figure 2 shows the level of urbanization and the fraction ofthe elderly 65 population across U.S. states in 1930. About 23 states those encircledintroduced a state pension plan before the 1935 Social Security Act. Of those, 18 states had 3 Cooley and Soares 1999, Galasso 1999, and Boldrin and Rustichini 2000 build models in whichnonaltruistic median voters decide to keep an existing system. The median votercid:146s decision depends on twofactors in these models: First, there exists a reputational mechanism in place which eliminates all futurebenecid:133ts if the median voter deviates from the current arrangement. Therefore, a median voter cannot avoidtaxes today and hope to get benecid:133ts in the future. Second, the median voter might want to keep an existingsocial security system in order to benecid:133t from the high interest rates associated with a depressed capitalstock.4 For example, Cooley and Soares 1996 study an economy in which the initial generation votes overa social security replacement rule that depends on the age structure of the population. Hence, as thepopulation structure changes e.g. as a result of the Baby Boom a rule that was sustainable in the pastcan become unsustainable. GonzalezEiras and Niepelt 2005 link the size of intergenerational transfers tothe age structure of the population. Conesa and Krueger 1999 study how the statusquo bias is related toidiosyncratic uncertainty.5 Krueger and Kubler 2005 study how the introduction of an unfunded social security system can be Pareto improving in an economy with incomplete markets.6 Also, see Pryor 1968.2an urbanization rate higher than the U.S. average. The correlation between the fraction ofelderly population and state pensions is also positive but smaller than that for urbanizationonly 65% of states with higher than average elderly population had adopted pension plans.Although this picture provides only suggestive evidence, the basic relation seems to hold upto empirical scrutiny. Amenta and Carruthers 1988 look at the timing of old age pensionplan adoption among U.S. states. They cid:133nd a statistically signicid:133cant eect of urbanizationon the passage of old age pension plans. More compelling is that the relationship remainsin crosscountry data. Figure 3 shows the correlation between the fraction of the labor forcein agriculture at the start of the 20th century and the date in which a social security systemwas introduced among European countries. Clearly, a larger labor force in agriculture is associated with later adoption. Kim 2001 investigates the timing of oldage pension adoptionacross O.E.C.D. countries in more detail and cid:133nds that the percent of labor not employedin agriculture is strongly associated with the adoption of oldage pensions.What were the economic and demographic forces that led to this shift from rural to urbanpopulation? One obvious answer to this question is the increase in the city wage relativeto the farm wage that arose from greater technical change in the city relative to the farm.GDP per person employed increased by a factor of 3.5 in the U.S. between 1870 and 1940Maddison 2001. While productivity in both the agriculture and the nonagricultural sectorsgrew rapidly during this period, the growth in nonagricultural sectors was faster than thegrowth in agriculture, leading to the transformation of the U.S. economy see Greenwoodand Seshadri 2002 and Greenwood and Uysal 2005. Figure 4 shows the change in totalfactor productivity TFP in agricultural and nonagricultural sectors in the U.S. Between 1800 and 1940, TFP grew by a factor of 1.92 in agriculture, while it grew by a factor of 4.21in manufacturing.Another possible impetus for ruralurban migration is the increase in life expectancythat took place over this time period. As life expectancy increased, two important changesoccurred in the agricultural sector. First, the amount of farm labor relative to farm land rose,causing farm wages to fall. Second, as farmers lived longer, the transfer of land ownership 3via inheritance was delayed. Both events increased the relative attractiveness of living inthe city for farmers, and encouraged ruralurban migration. Of crucial importance for thisstory is not that life expectancy at birth increased, but that life expectancy conditional onreaching or getting near retirement age increased. Figure 5 shows the changes in conditionalsurvival probabilities from age 60 to 65, from 65 to 70, from 70 to 75, and from 75 to 80.Survival probabilities increased by about 5 percentage points between 1850 and 1900, andby another 2 percentage points between 1900 and 1940.We propose a model economy in which structural transformation from a rural to anurban economy is modeled together with a political process that determines a social securitysystem. In our model, the emergence of social security is intertwined with social changes,demographics, and technology. We merge two literatures: the political economy of socialsecurity and structural change e.g. Laitner 2000 and Hansen and Prescott 2002. Thisallows us to study the set of demographic, social, and economic conditions that give riseto an economy without social security and the changes that could eventually lead to theintroduction of publicly managed old age security. We argue that this major structural shiftis important for thinking about the introduction of social security because the ruralurbanshift has implications for the provision of income for those who survive to old age.7 Aspeople migrate from the farm to the city, they can no longer rely on land as a source ofoldage security, and political support for social security increases.We study an overlapping generations economy with two sectors, which we interpret asagricultural and industrial. Farm production requires capital, labor and land. Land is a cid:133xedfactor, so there are decreasing returns to labor. City production on the other hand requirescapital and labor and exhibits constant returns to scale.8 Agents in this economy live up to 7 Although the Great Depression is often considered as a major force behind the social security legislationin the U.S., its eects are far from clear. Miron and Weil 1998 conclude their study on the origins of socialsecurity by stating that: cid:147Regarding the lasting impact of the Great Depression, our conclusion is thatthere were surprisingly little.cid:148page 321. On the macroeconomic eects of Great Depression, see Cole and Ohanian 2004.8 Hansen and Prescott 2002 model the industrial revolution as a switch from a Malthus productiontechnology with a cid:133xed factor of production, land, to a Solow production technology, with no cid:133xed factors.Parente and Prescott 2005 use a similar framework to study the evolution of international income levels 4three periods, as young, middle aged and old. They face an exogenous probability of dyingat the end of the second period of their lives. Land is passed from one generation to anotherby inheritance. Each period young agents make a once and for all decision about whereto live.9 There is also a social security system that taxes the young and the middle agedand pays transfers to the old. The level of social security taxes is determined by majorityvoting.10 In the initial steady state of this economy the relative productivity of the farmsector is high and survival probabilities are low. As a result, farm incomes are high relativeto city incomes. All agents live on the farm, and land is an important source of income forthe old. The median voter is a middleaged farmer who prefers a zero social security tax.When the city becomes more productive, people start migrating, and the importance of landdiminishes. Eventually, the median voter becomes a middleaged city worker who prefersa positive social security tax. While the framework is relatively simple, it leads to a richpolitical economy environment. The identity of the median voter is not just age, but alsolocation, which turns out to be critical for generating the emergence of social security. Thisis achieved by merging the structural transformation from farm to city with the politicaleconomy of institutions, in this case social security.11In the next section we describe the economic environment. In Section 3 we discuss theeconomic equilibrium, given an exogenous political process. In Section 4 we describe howsince 1750. Laitner 2000 study a twogood, twosector model in which, like Hansen and Prescott 2002,only the agricultural sector uses land. He studies why saving rate increases with development. Otherwellknown models of structural change are Echevarria 1997 and Kongsamut, Rebelo and Xie 2001.Greenwood and Seshadri 2002 and Gollin, Parente and Rogerson 2002 model the shift of labor fromagriculture to manufacturing, and the associated pattern of rural to urban migration, that is associated withprocess of economic development.9 Among recent models with an explicit location decision see Vandenbroucke 2008, Hassler, Rodrcid:237guez Mora, Storesletten and Zilibotti 2005, and Klein and Ventura 2006.10 The current paper follows the recent literature on dynamic models of political economy; see amongothers Krusell, Quadrini, and Rcid:237osRull 1997, Krusell and Rcid:237osRull 1999, Hassler, Rodrcid:237guez Mora,Storesletten and Zilibotti 2003, and Corbea, Dcid:146Erasmo and Kuruscu 2008.11 Graziella 2006 studies the long run decline in the importance of bequest taxes within a twosectoragriculture and manufacturing dynamic political economy model. In her model, land is easier to tax thancapital. The decline of agriculture, which reduces the value of land, makes bequest taxes an unattractiveoption over time. Galor, Moav and Vollrath 2008 study the eects of the concentration of land ownershipon human capital accumulation and growth within a political economy model.5taxes are determined. We provide some analytical results for a simplicid:133ed version of themodel in Section 5. In Section 6 we describe the results of our simulations. We conclude in Section 7.2 Environment Consider the following onegood, twosector overlapping generations model.In the cid:133rstsector or location, which we will call the farm, labor, capital and land are combined toproduce output. In the second sector or location, which we call the city, the same good isproduced using only labor and capital.Agents live a maximum of 3 periods, which we refer to as young, middleaged and old,and face a probability, cid:25; of surviving from the second to the last period.

Those who are born in the city are not allowed to move to the farm.The middleaged and old agents cancid:146t change their locations.12 Let the fraction of young,middleaged and old agents who live on the farm be denoted by cid:21y; cid:21m and cid:21o; respectively.In both locations young, middleaged and old all inelastically supply one unit of labor.13 Each agent is born without any assets capital or land and is endowed with location dependent e ciency units ji ; j 2 ff; cg and i 2 fy; m; og : Since only a frac12 The vast majority of migration from the farm to the city consisted of young workers. Schieber and Shoven 1999, p. 18, and U.S. Bureau of the Census 1975, pp. 139, 46513 We therefore abstract from the rise in retirement i.e. decline in the labor force participation ofold since 1850s. See Kopecky 2005 for a model with endogenous retirement that links this rise to thetechnological progress in the production of leisure goods.6tion cid:25 of middleaged people survive to old age, the total labor supply on the farm isgiven by N f cid:21yf1 cid:0 cid:21ycy 1 cid:0 cid:21mco cid:25 and the total labor supply in the city by N c m cid:21ofy cid:21mfocid:25.m 1 cid:0 cid:21oc Each period, agents are located either in the city or on the farm and can only work inthat sector. There is a competitive labor market in each location.

Capital moves costlessly between the farm and the city, solet r cid:26cid:0 cid:14 be the common rate of return to capital, where cid:14 2 0; 1 is the common rate ofcapital depreciation. There is no market in which agents can buy and sell land. On the farm,when an agent dies at the end of the second or third period, his land is inherited by theoldest surviving descendant. Therefore, a fraction of the land is owned by the cid:25cid:21o survivingold, and the remainder is owned by the 1cid:0 cid:25cid:21m middleaged who inherited land early.

Farmers rent their land to cid:133rms at a competitive rate q:In a similar fashion, in both locations some middleaged agents receive accidental capitalbequests from their parents. As a result, middleaged agents dier in their asset and landholdings on the farm, while they only dier by their asset levels in the city. If a young farmerchooses to move to the city, he gives up all claims on his parentcid:146s land, and that land, uponhis parentcid:146s death, is divided equally among the remaining land owners. However, he stillreceives any accidental bequest his parent might leave, as we assume capital can freely movebetween the farm and the city.Each sector is populated by a large number of production units family farms in theagricultural sector and factories in the city sector which have access to constant returns toscale production functions represented by Y f cid:13f F f K f ; N f ; L;27and Y c cid:13c F cK c; N c;3where variables Y j; K j; N j and L, j 2 ff; cg; refer to output, capital, and labor employedin each sector, and land used in the farm sector, respectively.

In 1850, those 60 years or older had about three times as much real estatewealth as the 3039 age group see Williamson and Lindert 1980, Table 1.7 and an analogouspicture emerges for total wealth in 1870 see Soltow 1992, Table 3.2. It is therefore notsurprising that Schieber and Shoven 1999 conclude that the over65 age cohort controlledmore wealth than any other group in the early 19th century.1414 Rubinow 1913, pages 302 and 304305 also notes that cid:147The authority of the patriarch is paramountand lasts longer than his productive powers.cid:1488Second, inheritance, and in particular inheritance of land, played a key role in wealthaccumulation. According to Soltow 1982 inheritance was the determining factor of wealthinequality in the U.S. during the 19th century. Inheritance was a much more signicid:133cant factorthan lifecycle savings in explaining the relationship between age and wealth in the U.S. in 1870. Moreover, land was the most important form of inheritance in the 19th century.In his study of Butler County Ohio, Newell 1986 documents that for the 18031865period, inheritance consisted almost exclusively of real property. Third, the farm populationconsisted mainly of workers and ownerfarmers. Renting the land to others was not common.According to Yang 1992, about 90% of farmers were owners in 1860.15 Finally, accordingto Greven 1970 and Newell 1986, inheritance was the main way to acquire land in settledareas.In the model people on the farm wait until their parentscid:146death to obtain land throughinheritance, and land is a critical part of agentscid:146lifecycle income procid:133les. Young and middleage workers without land look forward to inheriting land when old and therefore see littleneed for other savings vehicles. As Sass 1997, page 5 points out cid:147The family enterpriseinstitution also vested the old with powerful property rights visavis their adult children.Elderly parents held cid:133rst claim on the cid:133rm and its assets, while their ospring remaineddependent for their incomes and inheritance  parents retained ownership over the mainbody of family assets and chose when they would transfer farms and businesses to theirchildren.cid:148In the city, without land, the old are left to survive on wage income and savingsfrom that income alone. In this scenario, social security can provide middleagedcity voterswith a relatively high return.Before we move to a more detailed description of the economic environment and decisions,a few caveats are in order. First note that arrangements where the young and the middleagedlandless farmers pay the landholder of the family to gain control over the land when thelandholder dies would yield equivalent results to forced land bequests as long as the returnto land is greater than the return to social security for the landlessmiddleaged farmer, 2cid:25.15 Even at the end of the 19th Century, most farmers were owners, see Barlowe and Timmons 1950.9Note also that it is possible to relax the assumption that young farmers who migrate loseall claims to land. Once these original migrants inherit and sell their land, their ospringwill no longer have any land claims. As a result, this modicid:133cation would delay the onset ofsocial security at most a generation. Finally, since we abstract from population growth, it isalso quite natural to treat land as a cid:133xed factor in the model. Although large tracks of landwere available in the West, the main impetus for EastWest migration was the populationpressure in the East. Indeed, creating productive land was quite expensive and these costswere only incurred due to population pressure see Vandenbroucke, 2008.3 Economic Equilibrium At any point in time, the aggregate state in this economy consists of the distribution of capitalacross agents, the distribution of agents across the city and the farm, the last periodcid:146s taxrate, and an indicator variable of whether or not the introduction of social security was everoptimal for a median voter in the past. The role of this indicator function will become clearonce we decid:133ne the political equilibrium below. In this section, we assume that agents takethe political state as given.Since agents are born without any capital, capital is owned by the middleaged and theold. Furthermore, because they make dierent decisions, it is convenient to dierentiatebetween the asset distribution of landed and landlessmiddleaged farmers. We representcity residents and farmers by cthe distribution of capital across old city and farm residents by co ; and middleagedm with cid:20 1; 0 indicating whether a middleagedm ; fo to represent the set of distributions. We represent the distribution of agents between thefarmer is landed, cid:20 1; or landless, cid:20 0: In what follows we use cid:9 cm and f cid:20o and fm; co; f 1m ; f 0two locations, city and farm, by cid:3 cid:21y; cid:21m; cid:21o where cid:21j is the fraction of agej agentswho live on the farm. Finally, we use S cid:9; cid:3; cid:28cid:01; h to represent the aggregate state;where cid:28cid:01 is last periodcid:146s social security tax, and h is an indicator of whether or not theintroduction of social security was ever optimal for a median voter in the past. If h 1 itwas, if h 0, it wasncid:146t.10We represent the evolution of the aggregate state by three separate functions. First, welet cid:90 GS represent next periodcid:146s asset distribution given the current state S: Secondwe let cid:30 HS represent next periodcid:146s distribution of agents across locations. In thissection we describe the recursive competitive equilibrium given an exogenous policy rulethat determines the current social security tax rate and updates the history h. In particular,we assume that the social security tax level for the current period, cid:28 ; and the history indicatorfor the next period h 0, are given by cid:28 ; h 0 P cid:9; cid:3; cid:28cid:01; h; and agents take the policy rule P as given when making their economic decisions. Note that a system with a social securitytax cid:28 that never changes is trivially decid:133ned by cid:28 ; 1 P S for all S: Let Pcid:28 S representsuch a system. Once we decid:133ne a recursive competitive equilibrium for a given P and showhow G and H are determined, we describe how P is determined by the political process.3.1 City Problem We start by describing the economic problem of agents in the city. We approach agentscid:146problems recursively, starting from the problem of an old agent, whose state consists of theaggregate state, S cid:9; cid:3; cid:28cid:01; h; and his individual asset level a. An old agent in the cityo; asset income ra; and social security incomehas three sources of income: labor income wcccid:25 : Let V co a; S denote the value of being an old person with asset level of a: Since the oldwill simply consume their total resources, this is given by 2cid:28V co a; S uwcco 1 ra 2cid:28cid:25;s:t: cid:28 ; h 0 P S4where for expositional clarity we suppress the dependence of wc and r on aggregate state S:Next, we look at the decisions of middleaged agents. Unlike the old, the middleagedagents do not receive any social security payments, and they have to pay social securitytaxes. They also have to decide how much to save for their old age. Their decisions aredetermined by 11V cma; S maxa 0 fuwccm 1 ra cid:0 cid:28 cid:0 a 0 cid:12cid:25V co a 0; S0g ;5s:t: S0 GS; HS; P S;where next periodcid:146s asset distribution, cid:90; and next periodcid:146s distribution of agents betweenthe two locations, cid:30; are determined by transition functions GS and HS; while thema; S denote the savings decision of acurrent tax rate cid:28 is determined via P S: Let acmiddleagedcity person with individual asset level a that results from problem 5.Finally, we consider the decisions of the young agents who are born in the city.

Land per farmer may change due to migration, since migration alters the distributionof agents across locations, which is captured by cid:30 HS.When considering the young farmercid:146s saving decision, we need to do so jointly with hislocation decision. Some young farmers may stay on the farm, and some young farmers maymove to the city. Their savings decisions will depend on where they choose to live. Firstconsider a young farmer who stays on the farm. If his parent dies next period, he will receivean accidental bequest. The amount will depend on his parentcid:146s assets.

While we treat P as an exogenous function in this section, the other two transitionfunctions, G and H; must be consistent with individual decisions in equilibrium. In thissection we analyze how the savings and location decisions of agents determine the evolutionof aggregate assets and the fraction of agents living in each location.14We begin with the evolution of aggregate assets in the economy. In this economy, assetsare owned either by old or by middleaged agents. Hence, given cma and coa; the currentlevel of aggregate assets in the city, Ac, is simply Ac 1 cid:0 cid:21mZ ad cma 1 cid:0 cid:21oZ ad coa:Similarly, the aggregate asset level on the farm, Af , is Af 1 cid:0 cid:25cid:21m Z ad f 1m a cid:25cid:21m Z ad f 0m a cid:21o Z ad fo a:1213Given the particular demographic structure we have imposed, in order to determine theaggregate assets next period, all we need to know is the asset distribution of the middleaged agents. To see this, note that next periodcid:146s aggregate assets are determined by thesavings decisions of young and middleaged agents. Since the savings decisions of the youngdepend on the expected bequests and these bequests are determined by the savings of themiddleaged agents, in order to cid:133nd next periodcid:146s aggregate asset level Ac 0; cm aprovide su cient information: In particular, next periodcid:146s aggregate asset level in the cityma and f cid:20is given byyacma; S; S ac14ma; Scid:3 d cmaAc 0 1 cid:0 cid:21mZ cid:2accid:21mZ Laf 0Z Laf 1m a; S; Saf 0gyaf 0m a; S; Sd f 0m am a; S; Saf 1gyaf 1m a; S; Sd f 1m a:The cid:133rst line in this equation is the portion of next periodcid:146s assets that is determinedma gives the totalsavings of the middleaged agents.

The next two linescapture the part of aggregate assets in the city that come from young agents who just 15moved to the city. The savings decisions of these newcomers depend on their parentcid:146s assetand land holding status, and are dierent from those of the young agents who are bornin the city.

Tothis end, let Q 0; a be the set of possible asset holdings for an individual in this economy.m a and foa; f 1ma; c First, consider next periodcid:146s asset distribution among the old in the city.

One complication is that not all youngagents make the same savings decisions. While some of them are born in the city, othersmove to the city this period. Furthermore, some of those movers had landless parents andsome had landed parents. The following equation lists each of these cases: c 0mea ZQcid:25Ifacyacyacma; S; S acmama; S eagd c18Laf 01 cid:0 cid:25I 0yaf 0cid:25I 0cid:25faf 0gma; S; S eag 1 cid:0 cid:25Ifacm a; S; SZQ1cid:0cid:25faf 0gm a; S; SZQ1cid:0cid:25faf 1gm a; S; S af 0m a; S; S af 1cid:25faf 1gcid:25I 1af 0af 1af 1yyyLaf 11 cid:0 cid:25I 1m am a; S; S eagm a; S eagd f 0m a; S; S eagm a; S eagd f 1m a:The cid:133rst line represents the total assets held by next periodcid:146s middleaged agents, whoare young this period and were also born in the city.

The role of the function P is to determine astatecontingent social security system. We now focus on how the social security system isdetermined by equilibrium voting of successive generations. We assume sincere voting, i.e.that each agent votes for his most preferred alternative in each period. It is not obviouswhether an equilibrium with social security can be supported as a political outcome in ademocratic voting process with nonaltruistic agents. The current young and middleageddo not benecid:133t from the system, yet their support is critical. Indeed, the current young andmiddleaged will always choose to pay nothing in the current period, as long as they believethat the system will be there for them in the future.In this paper we consider a variant of constant social security taxes: i if a social securitysystem has never been in place, it may start at any point, ii once a system is operatingthe tax remains constant, and successive generations take a simple yesno vote whether ornot to keep the existing system.In order to induce the agents in this economy to vote for social security according tothis simple rule, we introduce the following reputational mechanism: if a majority of votersdeviate from the social security system, then the system collapses. Young and middleagedworkers balance the benecid:133t of not paying into the system against the cost of not receivinganything from it in the future. As a result, if they eliminate an existing system or if they failto start a system when it is optimal for the median voter to do so, they take into account thefact that the system will not be there tomorrow. Although the reputational mechanism weuse is quite stringent, we follow this route as it is the standard political economy approachin the literature see Cooley and Soares 1999, Galasso 1999, and Boldrin and Rustichini 2000.16 Finally note there can be many constant tax rates that are sustainable under thereputational mechanism we have just described. In the current analysis we focus on taxesthat maximize the lifetime utility of the median voter.16 Two early papers that emphasized the political sustainability of social security were Browning 1975and Sjoblom 1985.20Recall that P cid:9; cid:3; cid:28cid:01; 1 cid:28 ; h 0, where cid:28cid:01 is last periodcid:146s social security tax, and his an indicator of whether or not the introduction of social security was ever optimal for amedian voter in the past. If h 1 it was, if h 0, it wasncid:146t. In the following discussionwhen we say that the system has collapsed or has been dismantled we are referring to asituation where h 1 and cid:28cid:01 0:Decid:133nition 1 For any cid:28cid:01 0 and h 1; we will say that a policy function P S issustainable in state S cid:9; cid:3; cid:28cid:01; 1; if V M cid:9; cid:3; cid:28cid:01; 1; P cid:21 V M cid:9; cid:3;where V M is the remaining lifetime utility of the median voter in an economy with currentaggregate state S cid:9; cid:3; cid:28cid:01; 1 and policy function P; and V M is the remaining lifetimeutility of the median voter if social security is eliminated forever.The value V M cid:9; cid:3 only depends on cid:9 and cid:3; i.e. the aggregate state the distributionof physical capital and the distribution of agents between the city and the farm in whichthe social security tax is eliminated. In other words, P is sustainable in S if a majority ofvoters vote cid:147yescid:148 for keeping it today with tomorrowcid:146s taxes determined by P , instead ofmoving to an economy with no social security. Let the indicator function M S; P denotethe yesno decision of the median voter, i.e.M cid:9; cid:3; cid:28cid:01; 1; P 8:1; if V M cid:9; cid:3; cid:28cid:01; 1; P cid:21 V M cid:9; cid:30; otherwise:Note that a median voter considering a future without social security takes into accountthe resulting rise in aggregate capital stock and the decline in the rate of return. The declinein the rate of return gives the median voter an additional reason besides reputation tokeep an existing system.To decid:133ne the policy function P , we begin by noting that the history, h, of the socialsecurity system is important for its future evolution. Specicid:133cally, if the current tax level iszero, it is either because no median voter has voted for social security and a system is stilla possibility, or the system was dismantled in the past and no possibility exists of a positivetax in the future.21If cid:28cid:01 0, and h 1, then the social security system collapsed sometime in the pastand cannot be restarted. Therefore, P cid:9; cid:3; cid:28cid:01; h cid:28 ; h 0 is given by P cid:9; cid:3; 0; 1 0; 1;22i.e. once the system collapses, it can never be restored.If todaycid:146s political state is cid:28cid:01 0 and h 1, then sometime in the past a median voterinstituted his most preferred tax and this tax has been in eect since then: In this case, thecurrent generation simply takes a yesno vote and the system either continues at the sametax level or ends because of a no vote. The result of this yesno vote depends on whetherstate S cid:9; cid:3; cid:28cid:01; 1 is sustainable. Hence,P cid:9; cid:3; cid:28cid:01; 1 8:cid:28cid:01; 1; if M cid:9; cid:3; cid:28cid:01; 1; P 10; 1; if M cid:9; cid:3; cid:28cid:01; 1; P 0:23Note that if M cid:9; cid:3; cid:28cid:01; 1; P 0; then the system moves to cid:28 0 and h 1; and staysthere forever.The case that requires more careful attention is when cid:28cid:01 0 and h 0, since then asocial security system has never been operative. It may, or may not start today, dependingon the preferences of the median voter. If there has never been a social security system in thepast, the current median voter can make a proposal of a tax rate for a yesno vote. Letbcid:28 Sbe the proposal by the median voter at state S: Furthermore, let cid:28cid:3 arg maxcid:28 V M S; Pcid:28 be the optimal tax rate chosen by the median voter under the constant policy rule Pcid:28 ; i.e.the optimal tax rate chosen under the assumption that it will be in eect forever. We specify P such that P cid:9; cid:3; 0; 0 8:0; 0; ifbcid:28 cid:28cid:3 arg maxcid:28 V M S; Pcid:28 0cid:28cid:3; 1; ifbcid:28 cid:28cid:3 arg maxcid:28 V M S; Pcid:28 00; 1; ifbcid:28 6 cid:28cid:3:24Hence, if the median voter prefers a zero tax rate, then the social security system doesnot start.If the preferred tax rate of the median voter is positive, then this tax rate is 22proposed by the median voter for a yesno vote, and, if the preferences are singlepeaked, isaccepted by the majority as the current tax rate. Any other proposal by the median voterresults in the collapse of the system. It is important to note that the proposal by the medianvoter maximizes V M S; Pcid:28 cid:151 his lifetime utility under the constant rule. If cid:28cid:3 0; the taxrate will indeed remain constant as long as it is sustainable. Hence any sustainable cid:28cid:3; ifproposed by the median voter, will initiate a system that will last forever. It might, however,be the case that cid:28cid:3 0; and the median voter does not initiate social security. He is allowedto do that if and only if his lifetime utility is maximized by cid:28cid:3 0 assuming that taxeswill be zero next period. In particular, the median voter is not allowed to proposebcid:28 0hoping that a social security will start tomorrow. Such a proposal results in the collapse ofthe system. If such a proposal was allowed, social security would never get initiated sincesuccessive median voters would simply wait for the next generation to initiate the system.A political equilibrium is then a recursive competitive equilibrium with the policy function P decid:133ned by equations 22, 23, and 24. Once a median voter sets cid:28cid:3 0; thenfuture generations of median voters simply decide whether to sustain the system or not,knowing that once the system is dismantled, it is gone forever. Obviously, the median voterwho chooses cid:28cid:3 0; takes into account the reputational mechanism that is in eect.At a general level, not much can be said analytically about this model. In the followingsections we choose functional forms, assign parameter values, and perform numerical evaluations. Some valuable analytical insight can be gained, however, by focusing on a steadystate economy without capital. This is what we turn to next.5 Steady State Economy without Capital Consider a steady state version of the economy outlined above, i.e.let cid:30 cid:3; cid:90 cid:9;h 0 h; and cid:280 cid:28. In the steady state there is a constant fraction cid:21 of population that liveson the farm, i.e. cid:21y cid:21m cid:21o cid:21: Suppose the farm sector uses only labor and land, whilelabor is the only factor of production in the city sector. In particular, let the production 23function in the farm sector be Y f cid:13f N f cid:22L1cid:0cid:22:Hence, with L 1; the rental rates are given byandwf cid:22cid:13f N f cid:22cid:01;q 1 cid:0 cid:22cid:13f N f cid:22:2526Since we are in a steady state, the aggregate labor on the farm is N f fo cid:21: Notethat since land is a cid:133xed factor of production, there are decreasing returns to labor. As ay fm cid:25fresult, when people live longer and the farm sector gets more crowded, i.e. when cid:25 increases,wf declines and q increases. It is also the case that as people move out of agriculture thepressure on farm wages is reduced, since as cid:21 declines, wf rises and q declines.Let the production function in the city bewhich implies wc cid:13c. Finally, let Y c cid:13c N c;uc logc:2728Furthermore, suppose agents have access to a storage technology that transfers resourcesfrom current to future periods. In particular, suppose a unit of goods not consumed todaybecomes 1 r units of goods tomorrow.5.1 Saving Behavior of MiddleAged Agents We start by characterizing the behavior of middleaged agents who are most likely to bemedian voters in equilibrium. It turns out that the amount a middleaged person chooses tostore depends critically on the social security tax. For each middleaged agent there exists athreshold tax level that depends on his wealth. If the existing social security tax is greaterthan this threshold, then a middleaged agent stores nothing, while if it is strictly less than 24this threshold, he stores a positive amount. Intuitively, a personcid:146s threshold tax level recid:135ectshow much of his resources he would like to transfer from today to tomorrow. If the actualtax level is lower than what he wants to save, then the agent saves. Furthermore, if a personsaves, his savings decision is decreasing in the social security tax, increasing in his wealth,and increasing in the survival probability.These results are formalized in the next proposition. All proofs are in Appendix B. To Let I jstreamline the presentation it is helpful to decid:133ne middleage and oldage income variables.m; j 2 fc; f 0; f 1g; be pretax total labor and land incomes of the middleaged.

More importantly, if the nonsocial security income of the old is su ciently high relative to the pretax income of the middleaged,then the reservation tax is zero.Proposition 2 Given p and cid:28 ; for any middleaged person of type j 2 fc; f 0; f 1g: ima; p; cid:28 maxf 0; cid:12cid:251rI jcid:28 j A middleaged agent prefers to save a positive amount as long as cid:12cid:251rI jm1ra o ; i.e. he has relatively more resources when he is middleaged then he has when he is old.

The city worker who only has wageearnings, and the middleaged farmers who have land income both today and tomorrowface cid:135atter ageearnings procid:133les than the middleagelandless farmer. As a results, as longas a middleagedlandless farmer is the median voter and faces a steep ageincome procid:133le,he would prefer not to have social security. In our simulation exercise in the next Section,a middleagedlandless farmer indeed turns out to be the median voter in the initial 1800steady state and he does not want to implement a social security system. Once the medianvoter is in the city, a social security system emerges. We cid:133rst, however, focus on thistransition within this simple framework.5.2 How Can a Social Security System Emerge?We now consider the decision of the middleaged median voter.If the return to socialsecurity, 2cid:25, is less than the return to storage, 1 r, the median voter chooses a zero tax,and any agent who wants to save, saves entirely through storage. Suppose 2cid:25 1r. Then,if the median voter wants to save, he chooses a positive tax, saves entirely via social security,and stores nothing. All middleaged agents who have higher wealth than the median voter,store positive amounts, since they want to save more than the median voter. In both cases,the key is whether or not middleaged agents want to save. If they do not, then neithersocial security nor storage will be operative in equilibrium. This implies that in order forthe social security tax to be zero in equilibrium, either the return to social security must beless than the return to other vehicles of saving, or the median voter must prefer not to save.These results are outlined in the following proposition.Proposition 3 Given p; let a be the stored assets of the median voter, let ajm be the storagedecision of the middleaged median voter of type j 2 fc; f 0; f 1g; and let cid:28cid:3 denote his prem1racid:0I jferred tax rate. i If 2g:iii Ifg.ii If 2cid:25 1 r; then cid:28cid:3 2 0; cid:28 j; and ajg; and ajma; p; cid:28cid:3 maxf 0; cid:12cid:251rI jcid:25 1 r; then cid:28cid:3 maxf 0; 2cid:12I jma; p; cid:28cid:3 maxf 0; cid:12cid:251rI jcid:25 1r; then cid:28cid:3 0; and ajma; p; cid:28cid:3 0.o 2cid:28cid:3cid:25 m1racid:0cid:28cid:3cid:0I j1r1cid:12cid:252m1racid:0I j 2cid:121cid:25o1r1cid:12cid:25o To highlight the implications of Proposition 3 for the emergence of social security, considerthe following example. Suppose everyone is living on the farm. Furthermore to avoid the 26trivial outcome, suppose that the return to social security is greater than storage 2cid:25 1 r. Finally, let the e ciency units of labor be identical over time and across sectors andset to 1.In this simple world, old farmers want as much as they can get in terms of a social securitytax, while the young always prefer to have zero social security tax.17 That leaves the middleaged farmercid:146s decision to consider, which depends on their asset level. Middleaged farmersfall into one of two groups: those who have land and those who do not. It is easy to showthat middleagedlandless farmers are more likely to have a steeper ageearnings procid:133le thanmiddleagedlanded farmers, and so are more likely to prefer a lower tax level. Consider alandless farmer with assets a 0 and a landed farmer with assets a 1: Part ii of Proposition 3suggests that the tax level chosen by the landless farmer will be smaller than the one chosenby the landed farmer as long aswf 2cid:12 cid:0 1 2cid:121 rao cid:0 q wf 2cid:12 cid:0 1 2cid:121 ra 1 2cid:12q cid:0 q;29which reduces to1 rao 1 ra 1 q:As a result, all landless farmers prefer a lower tax level than all landed farmers as longas the landless farmer with the highest asset level has an asset income that is lower thanthe asset plus land income of the landed farmer with the lowest asset level. This is likelyto hold since the landless farmers receive no bequests while the landed farmers do. For thepurposes of this example, suppose this condition holds. Therefore, one can rank preferredtax levels in the following way: cid:28 fm cid:28 fo :y cid:28 f 0m cid:28 f 1Then, the question is who is the median voter. The measure of the young population is 1;and the measure of the old and middleagedlanded populations is also 1, since cid:251cid:0cid:25 1.This leaves the measure of the population that is middleaged and landless, cid:25, in the middle.So, in this simple example, when everyone lives on the farm, the median voter must be the 17 One can show, in an environment with no storage, that the young always prefer a zero social securitytax. Including storage only allows another alternative to social security and therefore should only bolsterthis result.27middleagedlandless farmer. If the middleagedlandless farmer who is the median voterprefers no social security, social security will be inoperative. This will happen as long aswf 2cid:12 cid:0 1 2cid:12a1 r q:30Clearly, this condition is dependent on parameters, but it is more likely to happen whencid:12 is small, q is big, wf is small, and r is small. If a person discounts the future highly, hewoncid:146t want to save, and will be opposed to social security as well. If the land return is highrelative to the farm wage, this implies that the ageearnings procid:133le for the landless farmeris steep, and he is less likely to want to save. And lastly, if a farmer has low asset incomewhen middleaged, he is less likely to want to save for old age. Overall it is more likely tohappen if the middleaged landless farmer faces a relatively steep ageincome procid:133le.Now consider a new steady state with a signicid:133cant fraction of the population living inthe city, so that the median voter is a city worker. The middleaged city workercid:146s preferredtax level is strictly positive as long aswc2cid:12 cid:0 1 2cid:12a1 r 0;31Condition 31 will hold as long as cid:12 12. If city workers do not discount the future tooheavily, or they have enough asset income when middleaged, then they vote for a positiveamount of social security, and the economy will move from a steady state without socialsecurity to one with social security.Discussion Land plays an important role in this framework for two reasons. First, it isa cid:133xed factor on the farm, so increasing survival probabilities reduces farm wages. Thiscrowding of land encourages young farmers to migrate to the city. Second, land providesinsurance for farmers. The promise of land upon survival to old age for middleagedlandlessfarmers creates a steep ageincome procid:133le that discourages saving. 18 A key to this result 18 The steepness of the ageincome procid:133le depends on the return to land relative to the return to farmlabor. With a higher share to farm labor, land plays a smaller role, causing the ageincome procid:133le of thelandless farmer to cid:135atten. See the example following Proposition 3.28is that there is no market for land. The inherited nature of land creates the wedge in ageincome procid:133les. However, if there were a market for land, as long as the return to land isgreater than the return to social security this result would still hold.The political economy aspect of the environment is simple, yet critical. Middleagedagents only pay into the system one period, while their benecid:133ts are based on two periodsof payments. This encourages support for social security, even when ageincome procid:133les arecid:135at. Land is not available for city workers as old age security. They earn only labor incomewhen middleaged and old. Therefore, they have ageincome procid:133les that are relativelycid:135atter than that of landless farmers, and thus are more likely to support social security.An important feature of this framework is that as the fraction of people living on the farmfalls, the identity of the median voter shifts from the farm to the city and support for socialsecurity can emerge. As was highlighted in the last section, in order for social security toarise at all, the returns to the middleaged voter, 2cid:25; must be greater than the returns tosaving, 1 r. But, even if 2cid:25 1 r; a middleaged agent might choose not to implementsocial security if he does not want to save.6 Economy with Capital We are now ready to carry out our quantitative exercise and evaluate if a calibrated versionof our model is consistent with the historical experience of the U.S. economy. Consider thegeneral setup from Section 2 and assume that young and middleaged agents save in the formof riskfree, productive capital. Although the basic intuition from the analytical results ofthe previous section remains valid, there are now general equilibrium eects at play as well.This is critical for two reasons. First, the changes in relative productivity levels and survivalprobabilities will not only determine farm wages and land returns via migration, but willalso aect all prices via changes in individual capital accumulation decisions. Therefore, itis fundamentally a quantitative question if the exogenous forces we consider and the generalequilibrium eects that follow can generate a farmtocity migration that is in line withthe data. Second, in their decisions about the social security system, agents still compare 29the return to capital with the return to social security, but the return to capital is nowan endogenous variable. This is important because while higher TFP levels after 1800push the interest rate up, higher capital accumulation associated with longer lives pushes itdown. Since, as we have emphasized above, the lower capital stock and higher interest rateassociated with social security can play an important role in the median votercid:146s decision tokeep an existing system, general equilibrium eects on the interest rate are of fundamentalimportance to the question at hand.In this section we show that a calibrated version of this economy can generate an initialsteady state in which a majority of the population lives on the farm and the median voterchooses not to introduce a social security system, and a transition to a new steady statealong which the median voter chooses a positive and sustainable social security tax. Weinterpret the initial steady state as the U.S. economy in 1800 and the cid:133nal steady stateas the U.S. economy in 1940. Computing the transition is nontrivial. Not only do thecapital stock and location choices and hence prices have to be consistent with individualasset accumulation and migration decisions, but the sequence of tax levels that individualsexpect must be those that the median voter in each generation chooses. In order to developquantitative implications of this model economy, we cid:133rst choose functional forms for utilityand production functions and assign parameter values.As in the previous section, let the utility function be uc logc: Since the productionside of our model economy closely follows Hansen and Prescott 2002, we borrow both functional forms and parameter values from them. In particular, we assume that the productionfunction on the farm sector is given by Y f cid:13fcid:2N fcid:3cid:22cid:2K fcid:3cid:30L1cid:0cid:22cid:0cid:30 ;Y c cid:13c N c1cid:0cid:18 K ccid:18 :and in the city sector it is These choices imply thatwc 1 cid:0 cid:18cid:13cN ccid:0cid:18K ccid:18;3032wf cid:22cid:13f N f cid:22cid:01K f cid:30;q 1 cid:0 cid:22 cid:0 cid:30cid:13f N f cid:22K f cid:30;andr rc cid:18cid:13cN c1cid:0cid:18K ccid:18cid:01 cid:0 cid:14 cid:30cid:13f N f cid:22K f cid:30cid:01 cid:0 cid:14 rf :333435The parameter values we use are cid:22 0:6; cid:30 0:1; and cid:18 0:4:19 We set the length of amodel period to 20 years. We also assume that capital depreciates completely,i.e. cid:14 1,which is not critical for any of the results.Next we select the values for relative TFP levels and survival probabilities. We borrow TFP numbers from Greenwood and Uysal 2005. For the 1800 economy we set cid:13f 1800 1800 1: Since the relative TFP values are the key determinants of migration decisions incid:13cthe model, we keep cid:13f 1940 2:19: These choices imply that the relative TFP growth is as reported by Greenwood and Uysal 2005 and reproduced in Figure 4.1940 1 and set cid:13c Historical estimates for agespecicid:133cmortality rates and life tables do not go back furtherthan 1850 see Haines 1988. In 1850, a 60 yearold man had about a 47% chance of livingto his 80th birthday. Since available evidence does not indicate any signicid:133cant improvementin mortality between 1800 and 1850, we set cid:251800 0:47:20 In 1940 the chances that a 60 yearold man saw his 80th birthday increased to about 56%. Therefore, we select cid:251940 0:56:city, i.e. j Finally, we assume that agents have cid:135at ageearning procid:133les both on the farm and in thei 1 for j 2 ff; cg and i 2 fy; m; og: Ageearning procid:133les in the 19th centurydid indeed dier from the usual humpshaped pattern. According to Kaelble and Thomas1991, incomes of working class household heads increased slightly between ages 20 and 40, but were pretty much cid:135at after age 40. These cid:135at procid:133les were a common feature of 19 The value for capital share in the city industrial technology, cid:18 0:4; is the standard value for thepostwar U.S. economy. The labor share is assumed to be the same for both sectors, cid:22 1cid:0 cid:18 0:6: Finally,cid:30 0:1 is picked to be consistent with historical evidence on agricultural incomes. See Hansen and Prescott2002 for details.20 According to Haines 1988, the crude death rate in New York City was as high in 1850 as it was in 1804see Figure 1, page 150. In many New England towns there was not much improvement in life expectancyat age 20 either see Table 1, page 151.31agricultural workers as well as low skilled nonagricultural workers.21 We make the strongassumption that ageearning procid:133les were also cid:135at in the city. We consider this to be aconservative assumption for our results, since a humpshaped procid:133le for city workers wouldsimply increase the incentives of middle aged workers to shift resources to their old age andincrease the political support for social security even further.Note that we cid:133x all these parameter values prior to running our simulations. We areleft with only one more parameter to pick, cid:12: We set cid:12 0:818 a yearly value of 0.99.This value implies that the yearly return to capital in the 1940 steady state is about 5.8%.22Table I summarizes our parameter choices.Table I cid:151 Parameter Valuescid:12cid:22cid:30cid:18cid:140.818 0.6 0.1 0.4 1cid:13f 18001cid:13c 18001cid:13f 19401cid:13c 1940 cid:251800 cid:2519402.190.560.476.1 Results Table II shows the results for the initial steady state in 1800. In our 1800 economy everyonelives on the farm, cid:21 1. This is consistent with the U.S. experience. At that time, about 94% of population lived in rural areas, and the fraction of population working on the farmwas possibly even higher see Figure 1. In the 1800 steady state, the median voter is alandlessmiddleaged farmer, who does not want social security, so the equilibrium value ofcid:28 is zero. Notice that this happens even though 2cid:25 about 4.25 is larger than 1 r, so 21 Doepke and Zilibotti 2005 contrast relatively cid:135at wage procid:133les of agricultural workers and land ownerswith steep wage procid:133les of entrepreneurs in the 19th century. They model the emergence of capitalismwithin a model of structural transformation in which entrepreneurs incid:135uence their childrencid:146s preferences inan attempt to make them more patient.22 Hansen and Prescott 2002 target a 44.5 percent rate of return on capital for postwar period. Cooleyand Prescott 1995 report a higher value, 6.9 percent. The value for the return on capital in our new steadystate is right between these two values. See Gomme and Rupert 2005 for a recent discussion.32the return to social security is greater than the return to capital. However, the middleagedlandless farmer prefers to save nothing due to his steep ageincome procid:133le.It is important to note that farmers participate both in the social security system andin the political process in the model economy, and the behavior of middleagedlandlessfarmers determines the fact that social security is not implemented in 1800 steady state.While farmers were indeed part of the political process as laws regarding social securityhad to be passed in both the Senate and the Congress, they were not included in the 1935Social Security Act. A simple modicid:133cation of the model in which social security taxes andbenecid:133ts only aect the city workers, while they are voted at the national level can deliverthe same results as long as social security implies some however small administrative costthat the farmers have to bear.TABLE II Initial Steady Statecid:28cid:21y 1 rwfqqcid:21KK f N f 1800012.4490.3110.3840.3840.0520.0522.470Median Voter middleagelandless farmer Table III and Figure 6 illustrate the transitional dynamics from the following exercise.We assume that the economy is at its 1800 steady state initially period 0 and suddenly andunexpectedly productivity and life expectancy increase to their 1940 values. In the period 33of the change period 1, the capital stock is cid:133xed at its initial steady state level. However,due to the higher productivity in the city and the higher survival probability, the city is amuch more attractive location for young farmers and many choose to migrate, cid:21y 0:66:This population shift alters the labor supply on the farm and in the city. Indeed, since alarge fraction of population migrates in the cid:133rst period of the transition, both farm and citywages rise. Given the rise in productivity levels, the return to capital, which is cid:133xed at itsold steady state value, increases signicid:133cantly from 2.449 to 5.718. As people start movingaway from the farm, the return to land starts to fall as well.TABLE III Transition 001cid:28cid:21y 102345670.080.080.080.080.080.080.660 0.349 0.160 0.160 0.160 0.160 0.1601 r 2.449 5.718 3.718 3.443 3.203 3.126 3.088 3.072wfwcq K0.311 0.325 0.416 0.544 0.548 0.549 0.550 0.5510.376 0.501 0.528 0.554 0.563 0.567 0.5690.384 0.265 0.187 0.112 0.113 0.114 0.114 0.1140.052 0.052 0.168 0.232 0.262 0.272 0.278 0.280Because the migration only aects the location of the young, in period 1 the medianvoter is still a middleaged landless farmer, who prefers no social security.23 So, in the initialperiod of the change, the tax remains unchanged at 0. However, agents are aware that themass migration of young farmers to the city will shift the identity of the median voter in thenext period, and alter support for social security.In the second period of the transition, the initial young migrants now become middleagedcity workers, who support a positive sustainable level of social security, cid:28 :08.2423 We computationally verify that preferences are single peaked.34After the third period, migration stops and the fraction of young farmers remains at 0.16.However, the new steady state farm population takes cid:133ve periods to attain, as the initialyoung migrants age. As the population reallocates between the two locations and peoplestart accumulating capital, the return to capital falls to 3.718, and then converges to 3.072in the new steady state.Next, consider the 1940 economy, which is found in Table IV. Now about 16% of thepopulation lives on the farm, a value close to the 23% observed in the U.S. at that time see Figure 1. This is quite remarkable since nothing in our parameter choices targets directlythe fraction of agents living on the farm.TABLE IV Final Steady Statecid:28cid:21y 1 rwfwcqqcid:21KK f K c N f N c 19400.0800.1603.0720.5510.5690.1140.7100.2800.0120.2670.4132.167Median Voter middleaged city worker 24 Again, we computationally verify that preferences are single peaked in the period of the vote for apositive tax.35Consistent with historical experience, the return on capital is much higher in the newsteady state, despite a more than fourfold increase in aggregate capital stock.In 1940,about 16% of the population lives on the farm, but a much smaller about 4.3% fractionof aggregate capital stock is allocated to farm production. Also consistent with historicalevidence, the rental value of land declines signicid:133cantly. In 1940 it is about one third of its 1800 value.25 Lastly, note that while the returns per unit of land, q, fall, the returns to landfor landholders, qcid:21, actually rise, .38 to .71, which keeps them on the farm despite risingcity wages.In the new steady state, even though total labor supply in the city rises due to theincreases in life expectancy and in city population, because of the increases in technologicalprogress and in the aggregate capital stock, the city wage rises. There is no technologicaladvance on the farm. But the out migration of farmers causes labor supply on the farm tofall, and so farm wages rise. And, while there is a large increase in the aggregate capitalstock, the technological advance in the city, coupled with the increase in labor supply in thecity, leads to an increase in the return to capital.It is worth noting that the demographic changes alone would not lead to the ruralurbantransition that the U.S. experienced. When we only change survival probabilities, socialsecurity does not emerge, because the change does not induce enough migration. Indeed,everybody remains on the farm. The key eect of this change is an increase in the capitalstock because people save more anticipating a longer life.When only TFP changes social security does emerge but the ruralurban migration isnot nearly as pronounced. Roughly 33% continue to live on the farm in the data it is 23%and in our economy with changes in both survival probabilities and the TFP we get 16%.Furthermore, the social security tax is considerably higher than in the economy with bothfactors at work. This underscores the conclusion that the interaction between technologyand demographics is a powerful impetus for social change.25 According to Hansen and Prescott 2002, the value of U.S. farmland relative to GDP declined from 88% in 1870 to 20% in 1950 see Table 2, page 1209.367 Conclusion In this paper we oer one possible explanation for the emergence of payasyougo socialsecurity systems. Our story ties this development to the population shift from rural to urbanareas, a migration that has its roots in increased life expectancy conditional on reaching age 60, and in technological progress in the city that outpaced that on the farm. This story cid:133tsthe experience of the United States very well. We show that there is an initial steady stateconsistent with the United States in the 1800s, with most people living on the farm andno social security system. Changes in life expectancy and technological progress in the citythat are in line with those observed in the data initiate a transition to a new steady state.Along this transition path, a generation votes a social security system into place, which issupported throughout the transition and in the new steady state.The current framework can be used to shed light on two issues of fundamental importance. First is the question of why did dierent countries follow such dierent strategies inconstructing their social safety nets, choosing dierent degrees of reliance on state versusthe market.26 The current model provides a natural framework to link demographics, geography, and dierences in the structural transformation of countries to dierences in socialinsurance institutions. Second is the dramatic transformation that is taking place in China.Currently, there is no national pension systemnor much in the way of social insurance in China, but as the worldcid:146s largest ever peacetime cid:135ow of migration continues, and the traditional support systems via the family are dismantled, we would expect the demand for suchinstitutions to grow. We leave these questions for future research.26 Perotti and Schwienbacher 2008 study how large incid:135ationary shocks in the cid:133rst half of the XXcentury, which devastated middle class savings in some countries, aected their reliance on state versusmarket institutions.378 Appendix AFigure 1: Hernandez 1996, Table 4.Figure 2: The urbanization rates are from the 1930 Census, Table 6, page 10, available athttp:www 2.census.govprod 2decennialdocuments16440598v 2_TOC.pdf.
