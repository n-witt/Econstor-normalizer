Our analysis relates torecent theoretical contributions arguing that there is only a loose relationshipbetween the suitability of a task for offshoring and the associated skill level.Accordingly, wage effects of offshoring can be very heterogeneous within skillgroups. We test this hypothesis by combining microlevel information on wagesand demographic and workplace characteristics as well as occupational information relating to the degree of offshorability with industrylevel data on offshoring. Our main results suggest that in partial equilibrium, wage effects ofoffshoring are fairly modest but far from homogeneous and depend significantlyon the extent to which the respective task requires personal interaction or canbe described as nonroutine.

This isreflected in the labor economics literature by, for example, Autor et al. 2003,SpitzOener 2006 and Gathmann and Sch onberg 2010. In the internationaltrade literature, the concept of tasks has also entered into the debate on international outsourcing or offshoring. For example, Blinder 2006 argues thatcertain tasks that are interactive, i.e., require facetoface contact are unlikelyto be offshored e.g., hairdressers, lawyers while tasks without these characteristics may easily be moved abroad e.g., computer programmers. Levy and Murnane 2004 and Leamer and Storper 2001 also highlight the differencesbetween what may be called routine and nonroutine tasks, with the latter being less likely to be moved abroad. Grossmann and RossiHansbergs 2008influential paper picks up this thread, proposing a theoretical model that essentially redefines offshoring as trade in tasks rather than in the common meaningof trade in intermediate products.What is clear from the earlier literature and also from the empirical workpresented in this paper is that tasks are not synonymous with skills. While theremay be some overlap, nonroutine or more interactive tasks are not necessarily identical with higher educational attainment. This is an important pointthat has strong implications for the potential labor market effects of offshoring.Traditionally, the literature has concluded that offshoring from industrializedcountries has led to a shift in labor demand towards more skilled workers, implying that unskilled workers lose while skilled workers gain from this form ofglobalization e.g., Feenstra and Hanson, 2001 . However, when consideringtasks as well as skills, the conclusions change. This is what we show in thispaper.By using very rich individuallevel panel data, we are able to assess in detail 2wages, skill levels, and the nature of the tasks performed by individuals in theirjobs. This is combined with data on offshoring activities of the industry. We usethis data to empirically model the impact of offshoring on wages, and focus onhow the wage effect of offshoring is simultaneously determined by the skill levelsand tasks carried out by individuals. Thus, we study the interaction betweenskill levels and tasks and investigate whether within skill groups, the natureof tasks carried out by an individual determines the effects of offshoring onwages. As Grossman and RossiHansberg 2008 have suggested, the effects ofoffshoring depend on the cost of trading tasks, which may differ across differenttypes of tasks. Hence, our working hypothesis is that, in the absence of a onetoone relationship between tasks and skills, the interaction of the two variablesmatters. Our empirical results support this hypothesis.We use two strategies for identifying a link between offshoring and wages.The first is to use withinindustry changes in offshoring intensity and wages.Here, we look only at changes in the wages of individuals staying in an industry,and not those that occur due to an individual moving from one industry toanother as a consequence of offshoring. This makes our analysis essentially ashortrun, partial equilibrium analysis.1The second identification strategy is based on the idea that, in general equilibrium, individual is wage is determined not only by offshoring activity in theindustry in which i is employed, but also by what is going on in other industries.Specifically, the wages of i holding occupation k will, in general equilibrium, depend on offshoring activities affecting occupation k in any industry. Take, forexample, electrical engineers working in the automobile and machinery industries. Offshoring an engineers tasks in automobiles affects not only engineersin this industry, but also in the machinery industry, as engineers may movefrom automobiles into machinery and vice versa. Note, of course, that actualmovement of workers is not required to generate these crossindustry effects:the potential for movement is sufficient.In the growing literature on offshoring and tasks, we are, to the best ofour knowledge, the first to explicitly investigate the interaction between tasks 1This is a common assumption in the literature.It is, for example, implicit in the studiesexamining the relationship between relative labor demand and offshoring using aggregate industrylevel data Feenstra and Hanson, 2001. Studies using individuallevel data, such as Geishecker and G org 2008 or Liu and Trefler 2008 are based on the same assumption.3and skills in order to gauge the effect of offshoring of activities on wages.2We look at the labor market effect of offshoring by examining individuallevelwages rather than relative demand for labor at the firm or industry level.3 Thisallows us to take account of individuallevel heterogeneity, controlling for ahost of observable and unobservable effects at the individual and industry level,thereby avoiding aggregation bias.4Our empirical results show that wage effects of offshoring are heterogeneousbetween as well as within skill groups, depending on the degree of interactivity or nonroutine content of the respective tasks of workers. Thus, the moretraditional dichotomy between highskilled and lowskilled workers does indeedneed to be revised, taking the nature of tasks into account.Another important finding is that the partial equilibrium effect, that is,the impact of offshoring in the individuals own industry, is quite low. However, when looking at the effects of offshoring in a situation that more closelycorresponds to a general equilibrium settingwhen allowing for worker mobility between industrieswe find substantial wage effects that are economicallyhighly significant.5In the next section, we provide a brief review of the theoretical backgroundthat motivates our empirical analysis. We then give a detailed account of ourdata and the classification of tasks according to their degree of interactivityand nonroutine content. Section 4 explains the empirical model and addressespotential caveats. Our partial equilibrium results are presented in Section 5,while Section 6 shows our estimates when allowing for crossindustry worker 2The paper most closely related to ours is by Ebenstein et al. 2009, who use micro data todefine occupations as routine or nonroutine. They do not consider possible interactions betweentasks and skills, as suggested by other empirical work, however. Moreover, we expand on thispaper by using not only the routine vs. nonroutine distinction, but as an alternative approach,also classify occupations according to whether they are based on interactive vs. noninteractivetasks. In addition, Crino 2010 looks at the impact of services offshoring on labour demand whiledifferentiating between tradable and nontradable occupations. Finally, Baumgarten 2009uses micro data to investigate the relationship between offshoring, tasks, and employment stability.3Feenstra and Hanson 1996 is one of the standard references for such studies at the industrylevel. Becker et al. 2009 analyze the link between tasks, skills, offshoring by multinationals, andrelative labor demand at the firm level using German data. They estimate the relative demand forskills and tasks, respectively, applying the framework by Feenstra and Hanson 1996. They do not,however, allow for a possible interaction between skills and tasks.4While the analysis of Ebenstein et al. 2009 is also at the individual level, the nature of theirdata does not allow them to control for many observed individual characteristics or unobservedindividual effects.5This may explain why papers such as Liu and Trefler, 2008 that only look at the partialequilibrium or own industry effect often fail to find strong results and conclude that offshoringappears not to pose a significant threat to workers.4mobility. Section 7 concludes the analysis.2 Theoretical Background The theoretical model of Grossman and RossiHansberg 2008 can serve as aguide to motivate our empirical analysis. In their model, a firm produces outputusing a continuum of tasks that are performed by either lowskilled Ltasks orhighskilled Htasks workers. These tasks can be carried out either at home orabroad. Offshoring tasks is costly, and these costs differ across tasks. Carryingout tasks abroad may be advantageous due to factor cost differences, but thesepotential savings have to be weighed against the costs of offshoring.In this setup, there are three types of effects on wages if offshoring costsfor one set of tasks decline, that is, if offshoring of one set of tasks increases.First, increased offshoring of a specific set of tasks raises the productivity ofthe factor that usually performs these tasks, and thereby generates a real wageincrease for this factor. Second, there is a labor supply effect. The excessworkers who have been freed up through offshoring have to be reabsorbed inthe economy, which leads to a fall in the real wage for the factor that performsthe offshored tasks. Third, there is a relative price effect, whereby the price ofthe final good that uses offshoring declines. This will, via the familiar StolperSamuelson effect, also negatively affect the wages of the workers that carry outthe offshored task. In sum, the model predicts an ambiguous effect of increasedoffshoring depending on the relative strength of the positive productivity andnegative factor supply and relative price effects.Note that, for our empirical strategy, it is important to point out that theproductivity and labor supply effects are elaborated in the Grossmann and RossiHansberg model in a setting where they focus on a single sector with afixed supply of low and highskilled workers. This scenario corresponds to ashortrun view of the economy, where labor is immobile between industries, andthus to our first identification strategy, where we examine the impact of changesin withinindustry offshoring on withinindustry wages, abstracting from themobility of labor across industries. These two effects also hold in general equilibrium, where the additional relative price effect also comes into play.Rather than solely testing the model predictions for lowskilled and highskilled workers, we expand on the idea that different sets of tasks have different 5offshoring costs, which may be only loosely related to skills. Thus, we go beyondsimply associating what Grossman and RossiHansberg call Ltasks and Htasks with lowskilled and highskilled workers. If it is indeed the case that,for example,nonroutine tasks are less easily offshored i.e., have higher costsof being offshored, as suggested in recent papers, then we would expect that,within the group of, say, lowskilled workers, the wage effects of offshoringshould differ for those individuals carrying out nonroutine tasks as comparedto those who perform simple routine tasks. The same goes for highskilledworkers. Our empirical results are in line with this contention.3 Data and Methodology The empirical strategy in this paper rests on combining individuallevel dataon wages and worker characteristics with more aggregate data on offshoringactivity and other observable industry characteristics. For the former, we usedata from the German SocioEconomic Panel SOEP, an annual individuallevel survey, for the years 19912006.6 We restrict our unbalanced sample toprimeage 1865 years employees in the manufacturing industry NACEISIC1536. To account for genderspecific labor market outcomes see, e.g., Prasad,2004; Beaudry and Green, 2003 we focus exclusively on males. In our empirical model, we utilize retrospectively collected yearly labor earnings and yearlywork hours from the CrossNational Equivalent files CNEF, including payments from bonuses, overtime, and profitsharing. Excluding observations withmissing or imputed wage information, this yields 13,189 observations for 2,063individuals.7In order to obtain taskbased measures of offshorability we employ occupational information following the classification of the German Federal Statistical Office Klassifizierung der Berufe Kld B92 that has only recently becomeavailable in the SOEP. On the basis of this disaggregated occupational coding,6Specifically, we use sample AF of SOEP. The data was extracted using the addon package Panel Whiz for Stata. Panelwhiz http:www.Panel Whiz.eu was written by Dr. John P. Haisken De New johnPanel Whiz.eu. See HaiskenDe New and Hahn 2006 for details. The dofile generated by Panel Whiz to retrieve the data in the present paper is available from the authors uponrequest. Any data or computational errors in the paper are our own.7According to Frick and Grabka 2003, the imputation procedure disregards industrylevelinformation such as offshoring. As a result, the imputation of missing wage information compressesthe wage distribution with respect to the industrylevel variables that are of most interest for ouranalysis and is therefore not suitable for this application.6we can map associated task contents, which are calculated using yet anothermicrolevel data set, the German Qualification and Career Survey 199899,by applying two different procedures that are based on Becker, Ekholm and Muendler 2009 and SpitzOener 2006.8To make the German Qualification and Career Survey sample comparableto the one used in our wage regression, we restrict the sample to males aged 18to 65, which leaves us with some 19,000 individuals out of about 34,000. Ouroccupational grouping is based on the twodigit level of the Kld B92, which isavailable in both data sets. Only in cases where occupational cells become toosmall do we switch to the nexthighest level of aggregation.9The distinct advantage of this survey is that respondents not only statetheir occupation but also give a detailed account of the tasks they perform onthe job and the associated work tools they use to do so. Using this detailedinformation, Becker et al. 2009 propose a mapping of tasks into occupations.In a first step, each of the 81 surveyed tools and thereby each task is classifiedas i routine or nonroutine and ii interactive or noninteractive, where theformer grouping refers to nonrepetitive tasks and the latter to tasks requiringinterpersonal contact. For illustration, the use of an overhead projector orbeamer is coded as both nonroutine and interactive, whereas the opposite holdsfor computercontrolled machinery. Simple means of transport are an exampleof tools denoting an interactive but routine task, whereas precisionmechanicaltools are coded as nonroutine and noninteractive see Table A1 in Appendix 1 for a list of surveyed tools and their respective classifications.In a next step, the number of nonroutine and of interactive tasks are averaged over occupations. Accordingly, a higher number implies a more intensiveuse of the associated task category.Finally, for every occupation, a continuous task intensity measure in therange of 0 to 1 where 1 denotes maximum intensity is derived by normalizing the figures by the maximum sum of nonroutine and interactive tasks in 8The German Qualification and Career Survey was previously used, for example, by Di Nardoand Pischke 1997. Like Becker et al. 2009 we rely on the most recent wave as it follows acomparable occupational classification Kld B92.9The classification contains five levels of aggregation. The twodigit level is the thirdhighest anddistinguishes 88 occupational groups. The nexthighest consists of 33 occupational sections while thehighest level differentiates between six broad occupational areas Statistisches Bundesamt, 1992.7any occupation. Thus, in compact form, the formula reads as follows:T ask Intensity ij Average number of j tasks in occupation i Maximum average number of j tasks,1where i denotes the occupation and j nonroutine, interactive the taskcategory.To check the robustness of our results, we also use an alternative task classification which is based on a separate list of 13 job descriptions that is available inthe same data set see Table A2 in Appendix 1. It is the same set of questionsthat was first used by SpitzOener 2006 in her work on tasks, computerization,and technical change and subsequently employed by, for example, Borghans etal. 2008 and Gathmann and Sch onberg 2010. Whereas SpitzOener 2006follows Autor et al. 2003 and creates five task categories, we focus on measures of nonroutineness and interactivity in order to ensure comparability withthe Becker et al. 2009 mapping. The construction of the task measures isanalogous to the one described above.10 For ease of exposition, we will refer to this alternative task classification in the following as SpitzOenerbasedmapping even though it is not strictly identical. Although both task classifications have their pros and cons, we have some preference for the Becker et al.2009 mapping since it is based on a more detailed set of questions and hence,arguably, more suitable to reflect task content variations across occupations.Hence, occupations are classified according to their nonroutine or interactive task contents, irrespective of the associated educational attainment ofworkers. Accordingly, it is in principle possible to observe, for example, somehighly nonroutine interactive tasks to be performed by lowskilled workers,and vice versa.To what extent nonroutine and interactive tasks and skills, measured interms of educational attainment, are related is summarized in Table 1.11 Asbecomes apparent in the mean comparison tests, highskilled workers on average have occupations with a significantly higher content of interactive as wellas nonroutine tasks. However, from Figures 1 and 2 it also becomes clearthat although highskilled workers indeed tend to have occupations with higherinteractive and nonroutine content than lowskilled workers, there is significant 10Note that this constitutes another departure from SpitzOener 2006, since in her formula, thenumerator consists of the number of tasks assigned to a given category. However, the rankings ofoccupations with respect to taskintensity measures are not affected by the different normalizations.11The exact definition of skills is provided in the next section.8heterogeneity within skill groups. Thus, while higher skills and nonroutine andmore interactive tasks seem to be correlated, we can nevertheless identify lowskilled manufacturing workers that occupy positions that are highly interactiveor nonroutine and vice versa.Among the lowskilled, a typical occupation characterized by low nonroutine content is storekeeper, warehouse keeper while assemblers is anexample of an occupation with low interactivity. metalworkers, the largestoccupational group among lowskilled workers, score low in our interactivityindex but are in the medium range of our nonroutine indicator. On the otherhand, truck drivers display a low intensity of nonroutine tasks but havefrequent interactions with coworkers or third parties.Technicians are the largest occupational group among the mediumskilled.They carry out a rather high proportion of both nonroutine and interactivetasks. Whereas production foremen even surpass them in both dimensions,a typical occupation that displays considerably lower values is that of officeclerk.Engineers make up by far the largest share among the highskilled, followed by managers. Both occupations are characterized by high degrees ofnonroutine and interactive tasks, which also explains the rather low standarddeviation of the task indices for the group of the highskilled. However, thereis still heterogeneity. For example, computer scientists are characterized bya high nonroutine content but are less intensive in interactive tasks.The question for the econometric analysis is now whether workers withhighly interactive or nonroutine occupations are indeed differently affected byincreased offshoring than their counterparts with occupations that have lowinteractivity and are fairly routine. To answer this question, we follow twoidentification strategies. The first is based on the assumption that workerswages are affected by offshoring activity in the industry in which the worker isemployed, similar to, e.g., Feenstra and Hanson 1996, Geishecker and G org2008 and Crino 2010.In order to implement this strategy, we merge our individuallevel datawith industrylevel offshoring measures. Offshoring is constructed by combining inputoutput tables for imports provided by the German Federal Statistical Office with commodity trade data from the Eurostat Comext database. We 9follow a narrow concept of materials offshoring by focusing on imported intermediate inputs that correspond to a makeorbuy decision, that is, inputs thatin principle could be produced by the importing industry itself see Feenstraand Hanson, 1999. We consider this offshoring measure to be more accuratethan relying solely on affiliate employment as in, e.g., Ebenstein et al., 2009since i affiliate employment also reflects horizontal MNE activities and ii notall offshoring takes place through foreign direct investment. Formally we candenote offshoring as:OSjt IM Pjt jjt Yjt2with IM Pjt denoting imported intermediate inputs from industry j and Yjtthe production value of industry j at time t. jjt denotes the share of importscid:80Jfrom a foreign industry j that is consumed by the respective domestic industryj1 jjt IM Pjt total imports from industry j which are notj in t withonly used in manufacturing but also in agriculture, services, private and publicconsumption, and investments and exports in t.12Figure 3 depicts the weighted average offshoring intensity in manufacturingfor the years 1991 to 2006. Offshoring intensity showed tremendous growthduring our sample period: between 1991 and 2006 it increased from 6 to 8percent.4 Empirical Model To assess the wage impact of offshoring conditional on observed and unobservedheterogeneity, we estimate variants of the following Mincer wage equation:13ln W AGEijt DEM OGit W ORKit3e EDU Ceit e EDU Ceit T ASKitcid:88e 1cid:88e 12Note that the numerator in Equation 2 could also be derived directly from the main diagonalof the inputoutput table. We chose, however, to only construct jj on the basis of inputoutputtables and combine it with trade data to give less weight to potential measurement error of individualinputoutput tables.13Our empirical model builds on Geishecker and G org 2008 but goes further by incorporatingheterogeneous tasks into the model.10cid:88cid:88 IN Djt e OSjt EDU Ceite OSjt EDU Ceit T ASKitee j T REN Djt RDYjt j t i ijtwhere W AGEijt denotes individual is hourly wage in industry j at time t.Our controls include the standard variables in such wage regressions, see, forexample, Mincer 1974, Brown and Medoff 1989, Schmidt and Zimmermann1991. Descriptive statistics on all control variables are provided in Table 2.DEM OG denotes the demographic control variables for marital status, children, and geographic region.14 The second set of control variables W ORKrefers to workplacerelated characteristics such as size and firm ownership aswell as tenure.We also control for timechanging observable industry characteristics IN Dby including the size of the industry measured in terms of output Y andequipment and plant capital intensity Cap Equ,P lantY .To control for as much unobserved heterogeneity as possible, we make fulluse of the three dimensions, i, j, and t, in our panel data and decompose theerror term into industry fixed effects j, time fixed effects t, individual fixed effects i and a remaining error term ijt. In addition, the three panel dimensionsallow us to include a full set of industryspecific time trends T REN D thatcapture industrylevel technological change over and above common macroeconomic trends accounted for by t. In addition, we include research and development intensity RDYj as an inputbased industrylevel technology measure.Particular attention is paid to educational controls based on the International Standard Classification of Education ISECD. EDU C contains educational dummies for high education e High Skilled and mediume M edium Skilled education; low education e Low Skilled isthe omitted category.15In addition, we control for the nature of job tasks of individuals by including our constructed interactivity and nonroutine indices, respectively. We do 14We do not control for age as age together with individual fixed effects and time dummies wouldresult in perfect collinearity.15Lowskilled workers are workers with secondstage basic education, lower secondary education,or less. Mediumskilled workers have upper secondary education, postsecondary nontertiary education, or firststage tertiary education. Highskilled workers have at least secondstage tertiaryeducation.11this by interacting the respective task index with the educational attainmentdummies, thereby allowing for heterogeneous task effects across skill groupsEDU C T ASK. To account for the potentially heterogeneous impact ofoffshoring across skill groups and tasks, we interact offshoring with the educational dummies OS EDU C and also include triple interaction terms foroffshoring OS EDU C T ASK.Accordingly, the marginal effect of offshoring for the different skill groups ecan be denoted as:cid:181cid:182e ln W AGEijt OSjt e e T ASKit .4We therefore allow for heterogeneous effects of offshoring within skill groupsdepending on the corresponding nonroutine or interactivity index.The combination of microlevel data and more aggregate offshoring information can overcome a number of problems that haunt pure industrylevel studies.First, due to the detailed information on educational attainment in our microdata, we can differentiate between skill groups in a much more precise way thanthe commonly used manualnonmanual worker dichotomy e.g., Feenstra and Hanson 2001; Geishecker, 2006.Second, since individual wages must have a substantially higher variancethan industry averages, potential endogeneity bias is considerably reduced, thatis, individual wages are unlikely to affect industrylevel aggregates such as offshoring see Appendix 2. Nevertheless, we can also test for exogeneity of ouroffshoring measures using lagged values as instruments, and are unable to reject the H0 of exogeneity within reasonable confidence bounds see Table A2in Appendix 2.16Third, combining microlevel wage information and industrylevel offshoringdata results in a threedimensional data set that allows us to control for industrytechnological progress by including industryspecific time trends. Arguably inour context, this is more general than to only include research and developmentor technology measures, sometimes of poor quality, as most studies do e.g.,Berman, Bound and Machin, 1998, Feenstra and Hanson, 1996, 1999 .16It may, of course, be problematic to use lagged values as instruments, since orthogonalitymust frequently be rejected. However, in our application, one and twoyear lags are likely to beorthogonal, as indicated by the low Hansen J statistic in Table A2.12Combining microlevel and aggregate data can, however, give rise to contemporaneous correlation of the error terms ijt as demonstrated convincingly in,e.g., Moulton 1986. As has become standard in the literature, we therefore calculate clusterrobust standard errors applying the sandwich formula proposed in White 1980 and Arellano 1987. However, this approach has its limitationsif the number of clusters is small relative to the number of observations percluster. In our application, we look at 21 industries, that is, 21 clusters, eachcontaining a fairly large number of individuals. In order to check how sensitiveour results are to this type of cluster adjustment, we also apply a pairsclusterbootstrapt procedure with 500 repetitions that, as demonstrated in MonteCarlo simulations reported by Cameron et al. 2008, yields considerably moreprecise ttests.Furthermore, Autor and Handel 2009 stress the potential endogeneity ofindividuals tasks since workers may readily switch between different sets oftasks depending on associated wages. However, in contrast to Autor and Handel2009, we do not look at withinoccupation task variations. In our approach,every task intensity is linked precisely to one occupation. Arguably, we therebymiss a potentially important source of withinoccupation wage differentials.However, individuals rarely change occupation and when they do they are morelikely to choose occupations with a similar task content see Gathmann and Sch onberg, 2010 in order to minimize taskspecific human capital losses. Inour sample, only 445 occupation changes of 13,189 observations take placebetween 1991 and 2006. We therefore consider simultaneity between wages andtasks to be of lesser concern when looking at taskspecific offshoring effects.175 Partial Equilibrium Results We estimate various specifications of Equation 6 for different task groupings.The main estimation results are presented in Table 3 for the interactivity taskindex and Table 4 for the nonroutine task index following the methodologyproposed by Becker et al. 2009.In the present analysis, we are of course mainly interested in the effects ofoffshoring and merely control for any observable and unobservable heterogene17The importance of unobserved characteristics for determining initial occupational choices istaken into account in our model through the inclusion of individual fixed effects.13ity that may otherwise bias our results. Regarding the standard demographicand workplacerelated control variables, coefficients are identified through timevariation and generally have the expected sign and magnitude but, conditionalon our comprehensive unobserved heterogeneity controls, often cannot be estimated with sufficient precision.Note that pairscluster bootstrapped tstatistics performed for the specifications reported in Column c of Tables 3 and 4 always confirm the conventionalclusterrobust ttests or even point to statistical significance when conventionaltstatistics do not. Thus, in our application, the number of clusters industriesseems large enough to avoid the serious overrejection problems discussed byvarious authors and summarized in Cameron et al. 2008.Focusing on statistically significant coefficients according to our pairsclusterbootstrapped tstatistics in Tables 3 and 4 Column IV, we find, ceteris paribus,that workers who change into firms with 20 to 199 and 200 to 2,000 employeesexperience wage cuts of four and two percent, respectively, compared to firmswith more than 2,000 employees, our default category.18Regarding tenure, we have to reject nonlinearity and find a weakly statistically significant but rather small positive effect. Ceteris paribus, each additionalyear of tenure generates an average wage premium of 0.3 percent. However,overall work experience in fulltime employment plays a much more importantrole. The coefficients on fulltime work experience in levels and squared arejointly statistically significant 19 and have opposite signs, suggesting a concaverelationship between hourly wages and work experience. While initially everyadditional year of fulltime work experience raises hourly wages by about twopercent, the effect becomes smaller as work experience increases, and from 26years of work experience onwards, actually turns negative. For parttime workexperience, however, we find no statistically significant effects.In addition, we find recent unemployment spells to play a significant penalizing role for wages over and above work experience and unobserved timeconstantindividual characteristics. Individuals who experienced an unemployment spellduring the year preceding the interview month experienced hourly wage cutsof 15 percent when reentering employment. Whether this wage penalty of 18The effect is also identified through individuals who stay in firms that grow and switch betweencategories.19Ftest for interactivity based regression: F7.14, p0.00. Ftest for nonroutine content basedregression: F7.53, p0.00.14unemployment experience works through, for instance, actual human capitaldeterioration or is the result of labor market signaling is beyond the scope ofthe present analysis.Regarding educational attainment, we cannot identify any wage effects withsufficient precision. However, in a specification with individual fixed effects,this is what one would expect, as few individuals switch between skill groups.Similarly, we find only a weakly significant direct wage effect with respectto the interactivitybased task index when interacted with medium skills, andno statistically significant direct wage effects with respect to the nonroutinecontent of tasks. Again, this is likely due to the fact that individuals rarelychange between different types of tasks.20Regarding timechanging industrylevel control variables other than offshoring, coefficients generally cannot be identified with sufficient precision afterwe control for individual and industry fixed effects and industryspecific timetrends.21 The exception is the coefficient on industry research and developmentintensity RDY . While we find increases in research and development intensity to reduce hourly wages for all skill groups, the effect is only weakly statistically significant for highskilled workers. A one percentage point increasein RDY lowers wages for highskilled workers by about two percent. However, over the sample period RDY averaged over all industries has remainednearly constant so that the effect of technological progress is economically negligible. Note, however, that RDY is only one component of our controls fortechnological change and is complemented by a full set of year dummies as wellas industryspecific time trends.Conditional on our large set of controls for observed and unobserved heterogeneity, we can now look at the offshoring coefficients and their respectiveinteraction terms. As expected, the effects of offshoring are fairly heterogeneousdepending on individual skills but are also shaped by the ease with which different tasks can be offshored. To see this, however, one cannot rely solely on Tables 3 and 4.Equation 4 denotes the marginal effects of offshoring for the different skill 20Nevertheless, as educational attainment and task intensity are part of our interaction terms, itis essential to also include them in a noninteracted way.21Industry fixed effects are not perfectly collinear with individual fixed effects, since individualscan change industry. For these cases, industry fixed effects control for level differences in ourtimechanging industry variables such as output or offshoring.15groups. Accordingly, the specific wage impact of offshoring can only be evaluated at some value of the interactivity or nonroutine task index. Furthermore,what matters for the statistical significance of offshoring for the different skillgroups e is the joint significance of the coefficients e and e, i.e., the coefficientsof skillinteracted offshoring OSjt EDU Ceit and the triple interaction termsof skill, task index, and offshoring OSjt EDU Ceit T ASKit. However,rather than focusing on statistical significance, what we are really interestedin is economic significance, i.e., how much wages changed due to increased offshoring. Obviously, this information is not contained in standard regressionoutput.To ease interpretation of the coefficients and to illustrate economic significance of offshoring for various skill and task interactions, we engage in a thoughtexperiment and ask how much hourly wages would have increased or decreasedhad offshoring remained constant at its 1991 value.22 We do this separately forlow, medium, and highskilled workers, and further distinguish between thetypes of tasks within skill groups by looking at the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of the respective interactivity and nonroutine content of tasks. Table 6presents the outcome of this exercise for our interactivity and nonroutine content task classification, respectively. Bold figures represent simulations wherecoefficients on the skillinteracted offshoring measures and the triple interactionterms are jointly statistically significant.Focusing first on lowskilled workers, variables and interaction terms thatrelate to offshoring are found to be jointly statistically significant for the interactivity as well as the nonroutine content task classification. However, in linewith the reasoning of Leamer and Storper 2001, Levy and Murnane 2004,and Blinder 2006, the effect of offshoring is heterogeneous within the groupof lowskilled workers and indeed depends on the ease with which tasks can beoffshored.Applying the interactivitybased task classification, we find that had offshoring remained constant at its 1991 value, lowskilled workers in the lowesttenth percentile of interactivity, ceteris paribus, would have earned 32 eurocents i.e., 2.17 percent of 1991 average lowskilled wages more per hour in 2006 than they actually did. Lowskilled workers in the 50th percentile, how22Note that to do so we assume that changes in offshoring intensity are essentially marginal.16ever, only incur wage cuts of 10 euro cents, or 0.66 percent, while lowskilledworkers in the 90th percentile experience small wage increases of 10 euro cents,or 0.65 percent.When instead classifying offshorability along the lines of nonroutine contents of tasks, we find very similar effects. Taken together, the cumulative effectof increased offshoring is a 26 euro cent 1.73 percent reduction in hourly wagesfor lowskilled workers with the lowest content of nonroutine tasks. Lowskilledworkers in the 50th percentile of nonroutine content only experience wage cutsof 12 euro cents 0.82 percent, while workers in the 90th percentile gain 15euro cents 1.04 percent.Clearly, these partial equilibrium effects seem fairly small at first glance. Tosignify the size of the effects, assuming 1,500 work hours per year, offshoringaccounts for a 390 to 480 euro reduction in yearly gross wages in constant 2000prices for lowskilled workers whose tasks are most easily offshored. However,lowskilled workers whose tasks are most difficult to offshore, that is, workerswhose tasks are most interactive or have the highest nonroutine content, areonly positively affected by industry offshoring. Due to offshoring, their grossyearly income in constant 2000 prices increases by between 150 and 225 euros.23For mediumskilled workers, coefficients are only estimated with sufficientprecision when applying the interactivitybased task classification. Again, thepartial equilibrium effects of offshoring follow a similar pattern as for lowskilledworkers. Mediumskilled workers with the lowest degree of interactivity experience cumulative wage cuts of 38 euro cents 2.23 percent, while mediumskilledworkers at the 50th and 90th percentile experience cumulative wage gains of 7and 27 euro cents, respectively. For highskilled workers, however, statisticalsignificance has to be generally rejected.To test for the robustness of our findings with respect to an alternative classification of tasks, we proceed by employing the methodology based on SpitzOener 2006, which is discussed in more detail in Section 3. For completeness,coefficient estimates of our main specification containing all interaction termsare reported in Table 5 for interactive and nonroutine task indices, respec23Accordingly, our results also imply that taskspecific offshoring effects are one potential sourceof the recent increase in wage inequality within skill groups that has been documented in, forexample, Dustmann et al. 2009 and Antonczyk et al. 2009.17tively. When looking at the Ftests for joint economic significance of our interaction terms and the respective economic significance calculations reportedat the bottom of Table 6, it becomes clear that the effects of offshoring areidentified with considerably less precision when applying this alternative taskclassification scheme. However, at least for lowskilled workers, there are somestriking similarities across the different task classification schemes. Followingthe methodology based on SpitzOener 2006, we find that lowskilled workers who carry out tasks with the lowest degree of interactivity and the lowestnonroutine content experience cumulative wage cuts of 17 and 19 euro cents,respectively. Lowskilled workers in the 50th percentile of interactivity and nonroutine content, however, only experience wage cuts of 13 and 11 euro cents,respectively. At the same time, we find lowskilled workers in the 90th percentileof interactivity and nonroutine content to gain 3 and 5 euro cents respectively.These effects are, however, only at the border of conventional statistical significance when looking at the interactivity of tasks and only weakly statisticallysignificant when focusing on the nonroutine content of tasks.6 Results with worker mobility across industries We proceed by explicitly dropping the assumption that workers are immobilebetween industries, that is, we want to look at the effects of offshoring thatare more closely related to the general equilibrium. As already discussed in Section 1, in general equilibrium, individual is wages are not only determinedby offshoring activity in the industry j in which i is employed, but also byoffshoring activities in other industries l J, insofar as these activities affectthe overall demand for labor that individual i faces. What is important isthat no actual movement of workers is required to generate these crossindustryeffects; the potential for movement suffices.One way of approximating these wage effects of offshoring is to useoccupationspecific measures of offshoring. Thus, we allow for crossindustryeffects of offshoring by making the identifying assumption that workers are reluctant or unable to change occupation but readily switch between industries.In order to implement this, we build on Ebenstein et al. 2009 and construct 18occupationspecific offshoring by reweighting industrylevel offshoring measurescf. Equation 2 with respect to industry employment within a given occupationk as a share in total employment L within occupation k.Jcid:88j1Lkj Lk OSjt OSkt Accordingly, we reestimate Equation 6 substituting OSjt for OSkt.56ln W AGEikt DEM OGit W ORKitcid:88cid:88e 1e EDU Ceitcid:88 OCCkt e OSkt EDU Ceite OSkt EDU Ceit T ASKitee k T REN Dkt RDYkt k t i iktwhere W AGEikt denotes individual is hourly wage in occupation k at timet.Note that we now have 61 clusters occupations instead of 21 industriesin the partial equilibrium analysis. Thus, we consider standard cluster robuststandard errors and corresponding ttests to suffice and do not construct pairscluster bootstrapped tstatistics as before. Furthermore, we now control foroccupationspecific observable characteristics by including occupationspecificoutput, capital, and RD measures that are constructed applying the samemethodology as in Equation 5. In addition, to further control for occupationspecific technological change, the model also contains occupationspecific timetrends T REN Dkt. Occupation specific unobservable characteristics are captured by a full set of occupation dummies k. Since each occupation correspondsto exactly one time constant task intensity in our data, we have perfect collinearity between the two variable sets. Accordingly, our occupation dummies alsocapture the respective interactivity and nonroutine content of associated tasks.Tables 7 and 8 report the parameter estimates applying the task classification scheme of Becker et al. 2009. Regarding our standard control variables,coefficients are very similar to the ones in Tables 3, 4 and 5. However, when 19applying the occupationspecific measure from Equation 5 we find a much morepronounced effect of offshoring. Similar to the partial equilibrium case, we easeinterpretation of our offshoringrelated coefficients by looking at the joint significance of the respective interaction terms and by calculating the economicsignificance of occupationspecific offshoring for each skill group at selected reference points for the degree of interactivity and nonroutine content.As is reported in Table 10, we find strong occupationspecific offshoring effects for low and mediumskilled workers that vary significantly across differentdegrees of interactivity or nonroutine content of tasks.Lowskilled workers in the 10th percentile of interactivity experience cumulated wage cuts of 1.31 euros 8.85 percent per hour. For lowskilled workersin the 50th percentile of interactivity, this cumulated wage cut is 0.77 euroswhile lowskilled workers with the highest degree of interactivity only experience wage cuts of 0.29 euros. These wage effects are substantial and considerablylarger than in the partial equilibrium case. Assuming 1,500 yearly work hours,lowskilled workers earn between 435 and 1,965 euros less due to offshoringdepending on the degree of interactivity of the tasks they perform.A similar pattern can be observed for mediumskilled workers. The cumulative wage cut due to offshoring is highest for workers in the lowest interactivitydecile 1.64 euros and becomes less severe the higher the degree of interactivity becomes 0.73 euros for the top decile. Again assuming 1,500 yearlywork hours, we can calculate a cumulative wage reduction of 2,460 euros formediumskilled workers in the lowest interactivity decile, 1,515 euros for themedian interactivity degree, and 1,095 euro for the top interactivity decile.Interestingly, these figures are robust irrespective of which task classificationscheme is applied. When applying the task classification scheme by Becker et al.2009 but looking at the nonroutine content of tasks instead of interactivity,we find very similar wage effects. Lowskilled workers in the bottom decileof nonroutine content experience a cumulative hourly wage reduction of 1.06euros, which is much more severe than the wage cut for lowskilled workerswith tasks having a median nonroutine content 0.83 euros or a nonroutinecontent in the top decile 0.35 euros. Again, for mediumskilled workers, thepattern looks similar. Here the cumulative hourly wage reduction ranges from 1.23 euros for the bottom nonroutine decile to 0.72 euros in the top decile.20Furthermore, when applying a task classification scheme that builds on SpitzOener 2006 see Table 9 for coefficient estimates, cumulative wage effects of offshoring are again very similar. For lowskilled workers, these wagecuts due to offshoring range between 1.06 euros per hour for the bottom decile ofinteractivity and 0.09 euros for the top decile. Applying this task classificationscheme to mediumskilled workers, we find a cumulative hourly wage reductionof 1.56 euros for workers in the bottom decile of interactivity and 0.79 euros forworkers with median interactivity. Mediumskilled workers at the top decile ofinteractivity, however, actually gain from offshoring: their hourly wages cumulatively increased by 0.20 euros. When focusing on the nonroutine content oftasks, we find mediumskilled workers to experience wage cuts ranging between 1.63 euros and 0.08 euros depending on the degree of nonroutine content.Thus, in line with the argument put forward in, for example, Blinder 2006,a higher degree of interactivity or nonroutine content can indeed shield againstthe negative wage impact of offshoring. However in the context of the modelproposed by Grossman and RossiHansberg 2008, the wagereducing laborsupply and termsoftrade effects in most cases appear to dominate the positiveproductivity effect of offshoring for low and mediumskilled workers in our data.What is striking is the magnitude of the effects. While in partial equilibriumoffshoring only modestly affects wages, albeit in an interesting taskspecific way,the wage impact of offshoring is substantial once we allow for worker mobilityand, thus, crossindustry spillovers.7 Conclusion The paper analyses the effects of offshoring on individuallevel wages, takinginto account the ease with which individuals tasks can be offshored. Our analysis relates to contributions such as Blinder 2006, Levy and Murnane 2004,and Leamer and Storper 2001, who postulate that there is only a loose relationship between the suitability of a task for offshoring and the associated skilllevel. Instead, these authors stress that the degree of offshorability depends onthe relative importance of routine versus nonroutine tasks and on the extentto which personal interaction is needed on the job.For the empirical analysis we combine individuallevel data and industrylevel offshoring measures and classify tasks according to their degree of interac21tivity and nonroutine content, applying two alternative classification schemesthat build on SpitzOener 2006 and Becker et al. 2009. By studying theeffects of industrylevel offshoring at the individual level we can control for ahost of observable and unobservable individual characteristics, thereby avoidingaggregation and reducing potential endogeneity bias. The main contribution ofthe paper is, however, that by using microlevel data we can investigate theinteraction between tasks and skills; thus, we can identify taskspecific wageeffects of offshoring within as well as between the groups of high, medium,and lowskilled workers.In line with earlier research, we find the partial equilibrium impact of offshoring on individual wages to be rather modest and to vary according to individual skills. However, our empirical results also indicate that the partialequilibrium wage effects offshoring are heterogeneous within skill groups depending on the degree of interactivity or nonroutine content of the respectivetasks of workers.When looking at the effects of offshoring in a situation that more closely corresponds to the general equilibrium, that is, when allowing for worker mobilitybetween industries, we find substantial negative wage effects of offshoring forlow and mediumskilled workers. Furthermore, the magnitude of these effectsstrongly depends on the type of tasks workers perform. For instance, for lowskilled workers carrying out tasks with the lowest degree of interactivity which,arguably, are also the tasks that can most easily be offshored, increased offshoring between 1991 and 2006 accounts for a cumulative yearly wage reductionof 1,965 euros. For lowskilled workers with the highest degree of interactivity,offshoring can only explain a yearly wage reduction of 435 euros. Accordingly,when studying the labor market effects of offshoring, we argue that the traditionally proposed skillwage pattern needs to be altered by taking the varyingdegree of offshorability of tasks within skill groups into account.Figures and Tables 22Table 1: Description of Task Indices All HighSkilled MediumSkilled LowSkilled Interactivity Index Mean Standard Deviation Mean Comparison Test NonRoutine Index Mean Standard Deviation Mean Comparison Test 0.3620.1460.4910.0920.4010.1360.3230.138H0 : High M edium H0 : M edium Lowp0.000p0.0000.5000.2370.7970.1730.5720.2210.4130.187H0 : High M edium H0 : M edium Low Observations 131892080p0.0002156p0.0008953Figure 1: Distribution of InteractivityIndex by Skill 23051015Density 0.2.4.6.81Interactivity Index Low Skilled Medium Skilled High SkilledFigure 2: Distribution of NonRoutineIndex by Skill Figure 3: Offshoring in Manufacturing Note: OS19912006 2.21 % pts 240246810Density 0.2.4.6.81Non Routine Index Low Skilled Medium Skilled High Skilled 55.566.577.588.5Material Offshoring Intensity in %1991199219931994199519961997199819992000200120022003200420052006YearTable 2: Descriptive Statistics of Remaining Variables Mean Standard Deviation Hourly Wage in Euro D:Married D: Has Children D: F irm Size 20D: F irm Size 20 199D: F irm Size 200 1999D: Public Firm D: Firm Owner not reported Tenure in years Work Experience Fulltime in years Work Experience Parttime in years D: Recent Unemployment D: ISCED HighSkilled D: ISCED MediumSkilled Production Value Y in Bill.

We further can derive that, ceteris paribus, the size of thebias increases in as bias If in our example one were to use industrylevel data, as most relatedstudies do see e.g., Feenstra and Hanson, 2001 for a survey, it holdsthat: 0.agg CovOSjt, ln W AGEjtV arln W AGEjt.With disaggregated wage data we on the other hand have:disagg CovOSjt, ln W AGEijtV arln W AGEijt.Since CovOSjt, ln W AGEjt CovOSjt, ln W AGEijtand V arln W AGEijt V arln W AGEjt it follows that disagg agg.Thus, through the combination of industrylevel offshoring measures withmicrolevel wage data we can utilize the larger wage variance to reducepotential endogeneity bias. To illustrate, in our individuallevel datawe have V arln W AGEijt 0.1495. If one aggregates the individuallevel data to construct average wages at the industry level one hasV arln W AGEjt 0.0335.
