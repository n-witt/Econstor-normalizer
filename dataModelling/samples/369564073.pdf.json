In particular, a European grant contributes to the Germangovernmental program for equalizing regional unemployment. The goal is to bring it downto the national average by creating new andor by safeguarding existing jobs.In the given paper the distribution of available aid among 271 German labor marketregions is considered as an econometric decision problem. At flrst, the dependence of theunemployment rate on the amount of aid is estimated for each eligible region. Using thisdependence, the variance of regional unemployment rates is expressed as a function of theregional subsidies. The optimal aid distribution among regions is obtained by minimizingthis variance subject to the total budget constraint and administrative restrictions.The optimal flgures computed are compared with statistical data for 20002002. Theyshow that the regional unemployment in West Germany could be equalized better withvariance 3.50 against the actual 4.40 and with a simultaneous decrease in the averageunemployment in West Germany from 7.45 to 7.28%. In East Germany all regions areeligible, implying no administrative constraints and a high optimization cid:176exibility.Itenables almost perfectly equalize regional indices down to the variance 0.28 against theactual 9.76.Under the model assumptions, the actual results of the equalizing policy could beattained by half the budget granted.

Besides, it characterizes the regional governmental performance and servesas a governmental assistance criterion. Its equalization all over the country is expectedto improve the national output and to decrease the incid:176ation pressure Taylor 1996.According to Fothergill 2001 and Elhorst 2003, the unemployment disparity amongregions within countries is becoming a source of troubles in the European Union. Theyare getting comparable with that among the countries themselves Elhorst 1995, Taylorand Bradley 1997, European Commission 1999. The extension of the European Unionto the East, where the economical imbalance is aggravated by transition processes, makesthis problem even more acute.Compared with the unemployment at national and intranational levels, the regionalunemployment is relatively little studied. The 3630 page Handbook of Labor EconomicsAshenfelter and Layard 1986, Ashenfelter and Card 1999 contains nothing on regionalunemployment, and the Handbook of Regional and Urban Economics contains just a halfrelevant chapter on urban unemployment Crampton 1999. All of this illustrates how farthe topic is from the mainstream research.The belief that the nature of regional unemployment is similar to that of unemploymentin general is rather superflcial. The factors which are thought to explain disparities amongcountries e.g., Phelps 1994, Malinvaud 1994, Bean 1994, OECD 1994, Scarpetta 1996,like institutions of wage bargaining, social security, retirement, and taxes are not relevantto regions. Indeed, they difier between countries but not between regions within countries;consequently some other factors should exist.Elhorst 2003 has reviewed 41 empirical studies, where regional unemployment differentials are explained with the help of regional data. These models some are notimplemented in formulas are classifled as follows:1. Single equation models one independent and one dependent variable:a empirical models, mostly with no equations but nevertheless suggesting factorswhich might be used as explanatory variables,1112CHAPTER 1.INTRODUCTIONb the inverse unemploymentvacancy relationship, or the Beveridge curve e.g.,Jones and Manning 1992, Holzer 1993,c the cyclical sensitivity model which explains the regional unemployment as alinear function of the national unemployment; such a model makes sense ifthe regional and national unemployment cointegrate in the sense of Engle and Granger 1987 into an equilibrium conflguration e.g., Chapman 1991, Martin 1997, Baddeley et al. 1998,d the amenity model which explains the regional unemployment as a function ofaggregated attractiveness of the regions, for instance, recid:176ected by the wagetoinfrastructureindex ratio e.g., Marston 1985, Montgomery 1993.2. Implicit modelsa the migrationbased model which explains the regional unemployment by migration cid:176ows e.g., Molho 1995, Groenewold 1997,b the NAIRU model nonaccelerating incid:176ation rates of unemployment, or the Phillips and wagesetting curves e.g., Jones and Hyclak 1989, Payne 1995,c the BlanchardKatz model 1992 with four equations which links the regionalunemployment rate to labor supply, labor demand, wagesetting, and migrationof both population and flrms; a similar study on the regional unemploymentin the European Union is performed by Decressin and Fatas 1995.3. The accounting identity models which are based on estimating the impact ofa single individual, depending on his identiflcation either as a local unemployed,or migrant, incommuter, or outcommuter, etc. e.g., Gordijn and Wissen 1992,Wissen and Ekamper 1995.4. The simultaneous models with interactions, which take into account the feedback of the regional unemployment to the explanatory labor market variables, likethe labor force participation rate, degree of employment and earnings, labor demand,etc. e.g., Bilger et al. 1991, Blanchard and Katz 1992, Blackaby and Manning 1992,Decressin and Fatas 1995.As concluded by Elhorst, the models reviewed provide clearcut trends in the interaction between the regional unemployment and other labor market variables. It shouldbe noted however that these models directly or indirectly assume a kind of labor marketequilibrium, which is a certain idealization. The factors which violate the equilibrium,like governmental creation of new jobs, are not explicitly taken into account.1.2 Active labor market policies Active labor market policies are aimed at reducing unemployment and are implemented inall developed countries Fay 1996, Heckman et al. 1999, Martin 2000, Steiner and Hagen 2002. They fall into three main schemes.1.2. ACTIVE LABOR MARKET POLICIES131. Job creation is ofiering subsidies to wages mainly for shortrunning projects in nonproflt organizations. These jobs are often given to former longterm unemployedand are usually restricted to terms of about one year.2. Structural adjustments is also ofiering wage subsidies but with other goals and in acloser collaboration with private flrms. The subsidies are aimed at integrating theemployees into the main activities and are given for terms of about three years.3. Public training is a number of educational measures paid by the employment offlce. They are aimed at improving the chances for employment and increasing theemployment stability.According to Bundesanstalt f ur Arbeit 2003b, during the period of 19902002 onlyin East Germany 6.5 Mio workers, which is about the number of active employees, wereinvolved in these programs with the overall budget 138 billion EURO. Expenditures ofsuch a range require systematic analysis of their efiects.Microeconomic studies are based on comparisons between groups of participants andgroups of nonparticipants; for surveys see Hagen and Steiner 2000 and Hujer and Caliendo 2001. As follows from these surveys, there is no clear evidence of either positive,or negative efiects of the German active labor market policies on the future prospects ofthe participants. This indeflniteness has been also conflrmed by the recent report basedon large administrative data Hujer et al. 2003.Hagen 2003 criticizes the microeconomic approach for its stable unit treatment valueassumption Rubin 1980. In the given context it means that the control groups of nonparticipants are not afiected by the programs. Since the programs are very extensive,their indirect efiects on the nonparticipants are likely to be quite signiflcant. It implies aviolation of the basic assumption, making questionable the microeconomic investigations.The macroeconomic approach, on the contrary, assumes simultaneity and reciprocalincid:176uence of all factors within the economy. Several authors selected it as more appropriatefor estimating the indirect and net efiects of active labor market policies Heckman et al.1999. However, the macroeconomic studies based on regional data reveal no unambiguoustrends either B uttner and Pray 1998, Steiner et al. 1998, Hagen and Steiner 2000, Schmidet al. 2001, Blien et al. 2002, Fertig et al. 2002, Hagen 2003.In the most recent study Hagen 2003 applied three macroeconomic approaches to East German regional data: an augmented matching function approach which evaluates the efiects of the activelabor market policies on regional matching eciency, a reducedform approach based on the Beveridge curve which assesses the efiectson the regional job seeker rate, including both unemployed and participants in theactive labor market policies, a regional labor demand approach.The main flnding was a certain negative efiect of job creation and no signiflcant efiectof structural adjustments and of public training on the regional employment. In spite ofhaving used alternative approaches, a number of questions remained open.14CHAPTER 1.INTRODUCTIONIt should be noticed that both micro and macro modelling do not take into accountsuch general factors as accelerating technological transformations with new requirementsto the employees, support of Eastern Europe and globalization which channelled flnancialcid:176ows out of developed countries and moved some industries and services to the Third World, and the recession which started in Asia in the mid1990s and then expanded tothe West. Their negative implications can mask the positive efiect of the active labormarket policies, without which the labor market situation might become much worse.1.3 Unemployment and optimization The point left with little attention is the quality of realizing governmental programs. According to Lechner and Smith 2003, caseworkers do not do a very good job of allocatingtheir unemployed clients to the subprograms so as to maximize their subsequent employment prospects. It can imply that not the policies intended but their implementation isresponsible for their low eciency reported in empirical studies. In a market economy,underused possibilities and a nonoptimal behavior often cause redistributions and structural shifts which can lead away from the results expected. For instance, an imbalancedjob creation causes migrations which reduce local efiects.Lechner and his colleagues 2003 took part in developing a statistical expert systemwhich customizes the ofier for each particular unemployed client. This may be the onlyinstance of any kind of optimization approach in the vast research on active labor marketpolicies. In a personal communication Lechner was somewhat surprised to learn about myoptimization interpretation of his work. Elhorst after having compiled a comprehensivesurvey was not aware of any optimization approach.Such a general neglect of optimization methods is amazing in two respects. The rolewhich optimization plays in the modern economy is hard to overestimate Samuelson 1971. As far as it concerns market relations, the quasi optimization is guided by theinvisible hand, Adam Smiths 1776 metaphor for competition. This, however, is not thecase in the public sector with central planning and budget governmental programs. Consequently, optimization should be primarily applied in the public sector and particularlyin the domain discussed.On the other hand, almost all quantitative studies on unemployment are essentiallyeconometrical. Yet the founders of econometrics, the flrst winners of the Nobel Prize ineconomics 1969 Jan Tinbergen and Ragnar Frisch always linked econometrics to optimization. Among other things, both Tinbergen and Frisch were faced to unemploymentproblems and in the 1950s made pioneering contributions to econometric optimizationmodels Frisch 1963, Tinbergen 1952, 1956, see also Johansen 1974; this topic was selected by Frisch for his Nobel Address 1970. Consequently, there exist also historicalprerequisites for interactions between unemployment studies, econometrics, and optimization.How does it work in practice? To give an idea, imagine that we optimize unemploymentvs. incid:176ation within 0 10% by controlling incid:176ation by the Central Banks interest rate.The operational space is two dimensional, with axes being the unemployment rate U andthe incid:176ation rate I shown in Figure 1.1. The direction of axes is inverted to keep thetopright direction of improvement as traditional in utility theory.1.3. UNEMPLOYMENT AND OPTIMIZATION15I6Incid:176ation,in %012345678910Phcid:181minilli Preference  10 ! 10IUOptimumps 12rvcuIUe 10 9876543210UUnemployment,in %Figure 1.1: Econometric optimization model Certainly, not every combination of indices in the plain UnemploymentIncid:176ation isattainable. Econometrical methods based on statistical observations enable us to estimatethe analytical relation between unemployment and incid:176ation called the Phillips curve. In Figure 1.1 it is shown by the line U I 12%. Thus an econometric model imposes aconstraint, restricting the feasible domain.Next a policy maker has to decide which combinations of indices are preferable. Inreal multidimensional situations it is not that easy and an objective function utilityfunction which takes greater values at better alternatives is deflned.Figure 1.1 depicts the map of the utility hill with indifierence curves, along whichthe preference remains constant. They are level curves of the objective function y U 10I 10. Its values lie in the third dimension beyond the plane, determiningthe relief of the utility hill.Finally the optimal solution, that is, the preferable combination of unemployment andincid:176ation rates, is found as the highest utility point along the Phillips curve from thefollowing optimization problemminimizesubject toU 10I 10 maximize U 10I 10U I 120 U 100 I 10 :In Figure 1.1 the optimum is attained at the point 6%, 6% where the constraint lineis tangential to an indifierence curve. To attain the optimum, the Central Bank hasto cause the 6%incid:176ation by appropriately adjusting the interest rate for this purpose16CHAPTER 1.INTRODUCTIONanother econometric estimation may be needed.Summing up what has been said, the objective function represents the desired, the constraint derived from the econometric model represents the feasible, and their interactionresults in the optimal decision. Thus econometric equations can be regarded as constraintsin optimization models. In a sense, optimization adds an active element, the choice, todescriptive econometric models, making the next step in controlling the situation.1.4 Econometric decision models Just this philosophy was developed by R. Frisch and J. Tinbergen. For the flrst time,the term decision model econometric optimization model was used in Frischs workfor the United Nations Economic and Employment Commission in 1949 Bjerkholt and Strm 2002. This work was published as late as in 1955 and the idea of decision modelsbecame popular owing to Tinbergens On the Theory of Economic Policy 1952 wherehe acknowledged Frischs priority. Both Tinbergen and Frisch strongly promoted thesocalled quadraticlinear approach with a quadratic objective function maximized orminimized subject to linear constraints.The bottleneck was the objective function, and Frisch 1957, 1971 suggested the Multiplex Method to construct it from interviews. In the mid1950s he conducted wellplanned interviews with the Norwegian Minister of Finance Trygve Bratteli who became Prime Minister for the Labour Party in the early 1970s. Later this approach was tentatively used by Van Eijk and Sandee 1959, Chossudovsky 1972ab, Van der Geest1977, Merkies and Nijman 1983, Van Daal and Merkies 1984, Merkies and Hofkies1991, H usges and Gruber 1991, and Medelin, Aspedale and Pachio 1994.Frisch intended objective functions for decision models, but these plans had few successors. Frischs ideas were not really elaborated but only discussed by Hallet and Rees1983, Rustem and Velupillai 1984, Hughes Hallet 1991, and some others. In particular, Oswald 1985 explained perspectives of using econometric decision models forthe wage formation. Recovering objective functions of trade union leaders and of leadersof employers associations were supposed to imply the tradeofi between wage level andunemployment.Tinbergen payed a considerable attention to econometric decision models but wasinclined to derive the objective function from the formulation of the problem rather thanfrom interviews Kol and de Wolf 1993. Many of his objective functions are linear,but some are quadratic.It is the case of the model with flxed targets the idealcombination of variables, where the distance to the given point is minimized Tinbergen 1956.1 Tinbergens approach was further developed by Theil 1964, Fox et al. 1966,Chow 1975 and other leading economists.Tinbergens view at econometric decision models was more objectivistic than thatof Frisch. Deriving objective functions from sources other than interviews looked moreimpartial and scientiflc. Sharing this standpoint, several authors revealed objective func1Strictly speaking, it is dicult to avoid subjectivity even here. The distance in the econometricspace is illdeflned. Axes are measured in difierent units like percent, absolute flgures, dollar, or EURO.Determining their substitution rates brings the problem back to Frischs interviews.1.4. ECONOMETRIC DECISION MODELS17tions from panel data, in particular from tradeofis observed. These studies are howevernot quite relevant to proper decision models, since they are not aimed at flnding decisionsbut operate on the ones already made like consumer choices. Moreover, a decision isregarded as a kind of equilibriumbased optimization which is not exactly the subject ofdecision models. For a survey of related works see Dantzing at al. 1989ab where theobjective function of the U.S. economy is constructed.Tinbergen and his successors often considered abstract objective functions for analytical purposes, without numerically determining their coecients. The linearquadraticdecision model which seemed quite operational was rather a theoretical framework. Persistent Frischs efiorts to develop methods for constructing objective functions were notmore than practiceoriented. As concluded by Bjerkholt and Strm 2002, Frisch leftthis fleld of interest with work undone.Gruber 2002 remembers that in 1965, after 35 years of existence of the Econometric Society and 16 years after the idea of econometric decision models had been introduced,he found no operational method for constructing objective functions. In both Americanand German dissertations Gruber 1965, 1967 had to use a heuristic quadratic objectivefunction with no crossproducts and roughly estimated coecients of squared variables.In subsequent years the situation did not improve much Gruber 1979 and he triedto animate studies in econometric decision models by having organized four internationalconferences Gruber 1983, 1991; Tangian and Gruber 1997, 2002. Interesting experimentswere reported by Merkies; for the selfsurvey see Merkies 2002. A special method forconstructing quadratic and additive objective functions was developed by Tangian 20012003a and applied by Hilles and Tangian 2002, Schwarm 2002, and Teibach 2002.Dealing with econometric decision models turned out to be more complex than initiallyexpected. Compared with purely econometric models, they include an additional element,the objective function, and result in optimization problems to be solved. Unlike statisticalmethods applicable to almost all data sets, optimization techniques are not that universal.Respectively, econometric models are generally solvable but econometric decision modelsare not.This makes building a decision model a kind of art. It assumes the knowledge of thesubject domain. Selecting important factors, sorting out secondary ones, and formalizingilldeflned notions, relations, and preferences by variables, equalities, inequalities, andobjective functions requires intuition and inventiveness. Conflguring sophisticated optimization methods into a consistent model needs mathematical skills. Finally, the wholeconstruct must be mathematically manageable and computable.These claims explain why purely econometric models prevail over their optimizationextensions. Another cause is the situation in mathematics and computer science. Statistics as a mathematical discipline was well developed before the invention of computers,and statistical packages became available already in the 19601970s. Optimization, ormathematical programming, was developed mainly after the Second World War just tomeet new technical endeavors. Accordingly, optimization software was delayed, especiallyin the userfriendliness, by at least 20 years.The last but not least cause of disregarding decision models in economics is the speciflcity of scholarly work itself. Statistics meets its habitual tasks of description, classiflcation, analysis, and systematization. Decision making belongs to the competence of18CHAPTER 1.INTRODUCTIONengineers, managers, and policy makers. So a psychological factor is also present.Summing up what has been said, econometric decision models are still in their infancy.Due to a delay in their development and other diculties, they are much less used byscholars than purely econometric models. The latter are often sucient as explaining thedependence of economic variables and thereby restricting the choice of economic policiesto feasible ones. However, the policies restricted that way are still too numerous to makethe flnal selection. For this purpose an operational objective function, which distinguishesa decision model, is required.In particularly it is the case of active labor market policies. Econometric studiesanalyze their efiects: short and longterm employment, labor demand, migration, futureprospects of participants, etc. It is recognized that labor market policies are implementedadministratively with little use of optimization methods. Therefore, there is a hope thatdeveloping dedicated decision models can optimize them and improve their performance.1.5 About the given work Reducing disparities among regions within European countries is the aim of the Europeanand national structural policy. In particular, a European grant contributes to the Germangovernmental program for equalizing regional unemployment. The goal is to bring it downto the national average by creating new andor by safeguarding existing jobs Deutscher Bundestag 2002, Tetsch et al. 1996. It should be emphasized that this grant is given toequalize rather than to decrease the regional unemployment. The latter goal is subsidizedfrom other sources.The equalization of unemployment resembles the stabilization of an airplane. Thestabilizer consumes some energy of the engine but is necessary to provide a safe cid:176ight. Theequalization of unemployment takes some resources from the main budget of active labormarket policies but prevents from structural disproportions. A limited grant naturallyresults in a trend to subsidize in the flrst turn the jobs which need less subsidies ratherthan the jobs which are expensive for grantgivers. Since the price of a job depends ofprevailing regional industries and services, some regions are little supported and others, onthe contrary, get too much aid. This decreases the average unemployment but increasesthe disparity among regions.At present Germany is divided into 271 labor market regions, 204 in West Germany,and 67 in East Germany. The European employment policy restricts the regions to besupported to 23.4% of the total population Crome and Schwengler 2000, Hassold and Jung 2000. Taking into account economic diculties in East Germany, all its regions areeligible, and the budget is separate for West and East Germany. During the control period 20002002 all eligible regions received about six billion EURO; West Germany received 617.8 Mio, about 110, and East Germany 5360.1 Mio, 910 of the total.In the given paper we develop an econometric decision model for redistributing theaid among eligible regions in East and West Germany. The optimization is performedto equalize regional unemployment, according to the goals of European and nationalstructural policies.The modelling falls into the following steps.1.5. ABOUT THE GIVEN WORK19 Collecting data on regional unemployment in Germany These data are available from Bundesamt f ur Wirtschaft und Ausfuhrkontrolle2003, Bundesanstalt f ur Arbeit 2003a, and Statistisches Bundesamt 2003. Explaining regional unemployment rates as functions in regional subsidies Efiects of active labor market policies on the regional unemployment have beenoutlined in Section 1.2. As revealed by Hagen 2003 and several other authors, theregional unemployment rates depend on the subsidies granted to the regions. Forour study, we use the simplest linear estimation directly derived from the availablestatistical flgures. Operationalizing the criterion of regional unemployment disparity For this purpose, the least variance of regional unemployment rates is appropriate. The variance measures the mean deviation of regional rates from the nationalaverage, exactly what is required to minimize.The criterion of least variance, not always explicitly, is used in models of marketstabilization Gruber 1965, 1967, general economic stabilization Pindyck 1973,Friedman 1975, and optimal control Chow 1975, Blanchard and Fischer 1989.For using objective functions in budget distribution problems see Fandel and Gal2001 and Tangian 2003b. Expressing the regional unemployment disparity in regional subsidies To express the variance V VRegional unemployment rates as a function of regional subsidies it suces to replace the Regional unemployment rates in V by thelinear functions estimated at the previous step:Regional unemployment rate A Regional subsidy B ! V :Since the variance is a quadratic function in its entries, this linear substitutionresults in a quadratic objective function in regional subsidies. Building a decision model It remains to impose the total budget constraint and to restrict the aid to theeligible regions. The problem operationalized that way is linearquadratic, with thequadratic variance function minimized subject to a linear budget constraint andeligibility restrictions. Solving the optimization problem The linearly restricted quadratic programming problem is implemented in a computer program written in the MATLAB programming environment. For larger applications it might be possible to use the fast algorithm Tangian 2001. Analyzing the optimal solution The equalization is performed for West Germany and East Germany with separatebudgets. The flgures computed are compared with the actual statistical data for 20002002. They show how to improve the distribution of European and national20CHAPTER 1.INTRODUCTIONgrants among the eligible regions.In West Germany, the variance of regionalunemployment can be reduced from the actual 4.40 to 3.50 with a simultaneousdecrease in the average regional unemployment from the actual 7.45% to 7.28%. In East Germany all regions are eligible, implying no administrative constraints anda high optimization cid:176exibility. It enables an almost perfect equalization of regionalindices with the variance 0.28 against the actual 3.12.If the total budget were not separated for East and West Germany, the overallequalization could be much better, with the variance 17.32 against the actual 27.29.Moreover, the average regional unemployment also decreases to 9.49% against theactual 10.11%. It would however require to redistribute the aid to East Germanyand reduce the budget of West Germany to 110 Mio EURO against the actual 617Mio.Chapter 2, Model, contains rigorous assumptions and mathematical propositions.The motor of the model is the objective function, which operationalizes the idea ofequalization. As often happens in new applications, an additional theoretical developmentis needed. In our case, we introduce the variance operator which reduces computing thevariance to a vectormatrix multiplication, separates linear and quadratic operations, andthereby makes the optimization problem solvable.Chapter 3, Results, explains the model output represented by flgures and tables.Then we comment on the recommended redistribution of the budget among the eligibleregions. Next we suggest a tool for predicting the equalization efiects of subsidies ofvariable size, which may be useful while planning a future equalization policy. Finally, weestimate the economic gain from using the model.Under the model assumptions, the actual results of the equalizing policy could be attained by half the budget granted. These underused possibilities explain the low eciencyof active labor market policies reported in empirical studies.The last chapter Conclusion outlines perspectives for further developments and recapitulates the main results of the paper.Chapter 2Model 2.1Idea Imagine 20 pipes of difierent proflles with difierent levels of water. Imagine that we haveto reflll some eligible pipes with totally 10 liter water to the end of equalizing the levels.Since some pipes are larger than others, the flrst question to be answered is: How fastcan every pipe be refllled, i.e., which amount of water does increase its level by 1 cm?This analogy helps to understand our task. The pipes are regions, the water levelsare regional unemployment rates, and water is the subsidies given to regions which aretransformed into jobs and change the unemployment rate.An essential assumption here is the linear dependence of the regional unemploymenton the number of subsidized jobs. In reality it is not that simple, but such an assumptionliterally meets the formulation of the problem: The grants are expected to have an efiect,otherwise giving grants has no sense. The linearity is also not very restrictive. Indeed, the Taylor expansion of a process contains constant, linear, quadratic, and other constituentsof higher degrees with vanishing role. Consequently, the flrstorder approximation can bealways assumed linear.2.2 Data To be speciflc, consider West Germany with 204 labor market regions indexed byr 1; : : : ; 204 :The same model will be applied to East Germany and to the whole of Germany.Introduce vector notation for input data.u the column 204vector of regional numbers of unemployed in 2002,u the column 204vector of regional unemployment rate in 2002, in %,a the column 204vector of aid to regions from national German and European sourcesin the control period 20002002, in Mio EURO,2122CHAPTER 2.

Respectively, they are packed together into the constant termnr Ar.Now we make some intermediate estimations. From the given data, one can computesuccessively the following vectors.n the column 204vector of net unemployment rates in 2002 with no aid. For thispurpose we add the jobs subsidized to the number of unemployed, and then proportionally derive the net unemployment rate:n u j: u:urecall u 6 u ;2.1where : and : are elementbyelement multiplication and division of vectors.Our estimate assumes that those who got jobs due to the governmental subsidieswould otherwise remain unemployed.In reality unemployed can flnd jobs themselves, migrate, get retired, etc. If necessary, a comprehensive explanation of netunemployment can be substituted into the model.e the column 204vector of aid efiect the decrement in regional unemployment ratese n u ;p the column 204vector of prices amount of aid required, in Mio EURO for a 1%decrement of regional unemployment ratesp a:efor noneligible regions put pr 0 :From here we obtain the equation for the regional unemployment rate y as a function ofthe aid x to the regions:y n diagonalizep:1x ;2.2 Qz2.4.INDEX OF UNEMPLOYMENT DISPARITY23where Q is the diagonal 204 204matrix with the diagonal elements obtained from thevector p by inverting its nonzero coordinates pr 6 0 ! 1pr.If statistical data were available for several control periods then equation 2.2 couldbe estimated econometrically more accurately.2.4Index of unemployment disparity As already mentioned, the index of regional unemployment disparity is deflned as thevariance of regional unemployment rates.

The program performs three runs of the model from Theorem 2, separately for West and East Germany with their separate budgets, and thententatively for the whole of Germany with a joint budget. Each run outputs a flgure withan overview of the equalization stages; see Figures 3.13.3.The detailed results of all the three runs are compiled in Table 3.1.1. Figure 3.1 contains four graphs with their horizontal axes displaying West Germanregion numbers 1204 their names are listed in Table 3.1, and vertical axes showingthe unemployment rate. The regional unemployment rates are depicted by circleswhich stem from the average unemployment level, thereby visualizing the standarddeviation. Exact numbers are given in Table 3.1.a The top graph shows the initial situation in 2000 with the average regionalunemployment 7.24% and variance 5.15.b The next graph depicts the actual situation in 2002 vector u with theaverage regional unemployment 7.45% and variance 4.40. Compared with 2000,the situation got worse.c The third graph shows that the subsidies improved the situation. It displaysthe net regional unemployment estimated vector n, as it could be withoutsubsidies. The average regional unemployment is then 7.80% and the variance 6.78.d The bottom graph represents the indices equalized. Compared with the actualsituation in graph b, the average unemployment and especially the variance,which is the index optimized, are brought down to 7.28% and 3.50, respectively.2.

In 20002002 the unemployment increased in spite ofsubsidies 17.68% in 2000 and 18.21% in 2002, which also could not equalize it thevariance 8.91 in 2000 and 9.76 in 2002.

DETAILS29equalize it even better: The variance of the net unemployment 2002 in graph c is 9.17. So, the flrst aim of the subsidies was not attained.The bottom graph in Figure 3.2 shows the regional unemployment rates of East Germany almost perfectly equalized with the variance reduced to 0.28. Since all East German regions are eligible to receive subsidies, the equalization for East Germanyis more cid:176exible than in case of West Germany. The subsidies are thereby channelledto reduce the variance rather than the average unemployment, which holds at theactual level 18.21.3. Figure 3.3 illustrates what would be possible if the budgets of West and East Germany were not separate. The average unemployment could be reduced from theactual 10.11% to 9.49% and the variance from 27.29 to 17.42. This would require toredistribute 507.406 Mio EUR from West to East: Instead of 617 Mio EURO West Germany receives 110 Mio, or only 1.8% of the mutual budget.3.2 Details Table 3.1 with the program detailed output contains flve vertical sections.1. The flrst section displays the labor market regions and their numbers. As alreadymentioned, West German regions have numbers 1204, and East German regionshave numbers 205271.2. Section Data has six columns. The flrst two columns display the regional unemployment for the year 2000, in absolute flgures and in %. These data are not usedin computing but are important as the initial state of the control period.Next columns are vectors u; u; a; j of unemployment in 2002, the granted aid in 20002002, and the subsidized jobs. Blank spaces mean that the region is noteligible to receive subsidies, and is not processed by the model.3. The next section Econometric estimation contains three columns. Two columnscontain coecients of equation 2.2. They are vector n, the net unemployment,which would occur with no aid, and vector p, the price which the grantgiversshould pay to reduce the regional unemployment by 1%.The last column of the section, Aid per one subsidized job, is auxiliary. It showshow expensive is one job for the grantgivers.4. Section Separate optimization contains two parts one upon another. The upper partin rows 1204 displays the optimization output for West Germany, and the bottomsection in rows 205271 concerns East Germany, processed separately.Column Redistribution of aid displays the vector xa, how the actual aid shouldbe changed with regard to the solution x of the problem 2.4. A negative numbermeans that the region should give the subsidy or its fraction back; a positive numbermeans an additional grant.Column Equalized unemployment rate 2002 shows the vector y obtained from2.6.

RESULTSColumn Increment in unemployment rate displays vector y u, the predictedchange of the actual unemployment rate after the redistribution of subsidies.These rate increments converted from percent to the absolute number of unemployedare given in the auxiliary column Increment in unemployed.5. The last section, Joint optimization displays the results of unemployment equalization for East and West Germany processed jointly. The columns of this sections arethe same as of Section Separate equalization.6. Three bottom lines of Table 3.1 show the variance of the regional unemploymentrates. These indices appear in graph titles.3.3 Redistribution of aid The redistribution of aid for attaining the optimal equalization of unemployment is illustrated by Figure 3.4 It depicts Tables 3.1 columns Aid per one subsidized job, Aidneeded to reduce unemployment by 1% vector p, and Redistribution of aid vector x a both for separate and joint equalization.The greatest redistribution takes place in East Germany, where the subsidies are farfrom being optimal. Most afiected are large cities. For instance, Berlin has to return allsubsidies back. Dresden, Magdeburg, Jena, Wismar, Schwerin, Rostock should receiveat most half their actual grants. On the contrary, some other areas should receive anadditional aid: Naumburg 277 Mio EURO, Stendal 179 Mio EURO, Bitterfeld 118Mio, etc.The optimization tries to reduce the highest unemployment by least expenditures. Ifthe unemployment is rather high, the model subsidizes the region even at a higher price.If the unemployment is not much higher than the average but reducing it is afiordablethen the model gives a grant. The last subsidized are the regions whose unemploymentis close to the average and at the same time reducing it is too expensive.For instance, consider Berlin. It has a large population, and reducing its unemploymentby one percent requires subsidizing too many jobs, which makes this percent much moreexpensive than in small regions. On the other hand, Berlins net unemployment rate withno subsidies 18.7% is very close to the East German average 18:7 18:21 0:49%,so that it makes little sense to give a subsidy. Berlins actual unemployment 16.6%means that the subsidy 536 Mio EURO received was not only unnecessary but alsosupercid:176uous.Indeed, instead of fltting the unemployment to the average it results in 18:21 16:6 1:61%deviation, which is three times more distant from the average thanwith no subsidies at all.Besides the size of the region, the price of 1%decrement in unemployment is determined by the aid per one subsidized job. For instance, consider Naumburg with the priceof one job about 50 Ths EURO. Naumburgs unemployment 21.4% signiflcantly deviatesfrom the East German average 18.21%. Accordingly, it receives an additional subsidy,in spite of a high price for 1%decrement in unemployment. If Naumburg is consideredwithin the whole of Germany, its incid:176uence on the variance is about 310 of its incid:176uence3.3.

RESULTSwithin East Germany 1217 against 167. This is deciding, and Naumburg looses itsprivilege and has to return the grant.These and similar efiects can be taken under control by certain weight coecients. Forinstance, one may adjust the optimization process not to ignore large cities, or localitieswith expensive jobs like in shipbuilding.3.4 Planning the budget for an equalization policy Let us perform a kind of sensitivity analysis and investigate how the unemployment equalization depends on the budget. Figure 3.5 traces the efiects of the equalization policy asa function of budget a for West Germany, b for East Germany, and c for the wholeof Germany.a Consider the top graph for West Germany. Its horizontal axis displays the variablebudget. For several budget values, the regional unemployment is equalized. Theresulted optimal average unemployment and variance are put into the table on theright hand. The corresponding table columns are depicted by dashed and solidoptimal curves in the graph, respectively.The actual 2002 average unemployment and variance are marked in the graph byasterisk with the horizontal coordinate being the actual budget of West Germany 617.840 Mio EURO. Since neither the actual average unemployment, nor the actualvariance are optimal, the corresponding marks are located above the optimal curves.b The next graph for East Germany is similar. In particular, it visualizes the factthat the actual average unemployment is optimal: The corresponding mark is inthe dashed curve. The variance is not optimal and lies signiflcantly above the curveof optimal variance.c For West Germany, the actual situation is not optimal either. The marks of actualaverage unemployment and variance lie above the optimal curves. Comparing withgraph b, graph c exhibits a much steeper decrease in the variance. This meansthat a joint budget might be quite ecient and could better equalize the situationin Germany than two separate budgets.The curves and tables from Figure 3.5 enable us to predict the efiect of an equalizationpolicy with a certain budget. For instance, if we speak of West Germany and test a budgetof 300 Mio EURO, then, under the optimal equalization, the predicted average regionalunemployment is 7.44% and the variance 4.21. If we dispose a budget of 1 Bio EUROthen the predicted average unemployment is 7.12% and the variance is 2.98. One can ask:Are we ready to pay additional 700 Mio for such a minor improvement?Using the curves and tables from Figure 3.5, one can answer similar questions andselect the most appropriate equalization policy with the best qualitytoprice ratio theunderstanding of which depends on the policy maker. Then the optimal distribution ofthe budget among all the eligible regions follows immediately from the main model.3.4.

RESULTS3.5 Economic gain from the model As shown previously, the model promises a better equalization of the regional unemployment than actually attained. It implies that the actual degree of equalization is attainablewith a smaller budget. Say, the results obtained for 6 billion EURO can be obtained for 4 billion. Then the gain from the model is 2 billion.Let us trace this train of thought with Figure 3.5. Consider the mark Variance 2002in the upper graph a for West Germany. It indicates the actual state attained for 617Mio EURO. Moving to the left along the dashdot line, we retain the equalization level butreduce the budget. Attaining the optimal variance curve means that no further economyis possible. The necessary budget is to be found below, 240.901 Mio EURO. Startingfrom the mark Average unemployment 2002 and proceeding in the same way, we flndthe minimal budget for the actual average unemployment 7.45%, 280.737 Mio EURO.The budget which suces to retain both indices at the actual level is consequently themaximal of these two, 280.737 Mio EURO. We save 337.103 Mio. If we restrict attentionto the variance only, as required by the equalization program, the minimal budget is 240.901 Mio, which saves 376.939 Mio. Then the average unemployment is 7.48% whichis 0.03% higher than the actual one.These steps are tabulated in Table 3.2. Its three rows provide the estimates of economicgain for West Germany, East Germany, and the whole Germany.1. Consider the flrst row for West Germany.a The flrst section State 2002 specifles the location of marks in Figure 3.5. Theunderlying data are represented by the second graph in Figure 3.1.b The next section of Table 3.2 Optimal equalization displays the equalizationresult for the whole budget. The optimal indices, compared with the actualones, indicate at a gain in quality. The underlying data are represented by thebottom graph in Figure 3.1.c Section Economy equalization AV answers to the question: How can the actualbudget be reduced with retaining both Average unemployment and V arianceat the actual level? This section specifles the intersection of dashdot lines withthe optimal curves in Figure 3.5.d The last section Economy equalization V is similar but restricts the attentionto the V ariance only. It specifles the intersection of the dashdot line throughthe mark Variance 2002 with the optimal variance curve in Figure 3.5.2. For East Germany, the situation is rather curious.a If we take care of both average unemployment and variance Section Economyequalization AV, no economy is possible 0 EURO. It is explained by the factthat the average unemployment under the optimal equalization coincides withthe actual one compare with Section Actual equalization.b If we take care of the variance only then no grant is necessary at all Section Economy equalization V. Indeed, the natural selfregulation provides a betterTable 3.2:Economic gain from the unemployment equalization Economy equalization AVEconomy equalization VState 2002Aid Varianceamount Averageunemploymentrate%2 Mio EUR %Optimal equalization Aid Varianceamount Averageunemploymentrate%2 Mio EUR %Variance Sufflcientaid Economy Averageunemploymentrate%2 Mio EUR Mio EUR %Averageunemploymentrate%7:4518:2110:11West Germany East Germany Whole of Germany 4:40617:8409:76 5360:10027:29 5977:9407:2818:219:493:50617:8400:28 5360:10017:32 5977:9407:4518:2110:114:27280:7370:28 5360:100337:1030:00025:30 3486:612 2491:3287:4822:9310:25Variance Sufflcientaid Economy%2 Mio EUR Mio EUR376:9390:000 5360:10027:29 3005:170 2972:7704:409:17240:9013.5.IIECONOMCGANFROMTHEMODEL4344CHAPTER 3. RESULTSvariance than attained with the grant see second and third graphs in Figure 3.2. Consequently, the total budget of 5360.100 Mio EURO can be saved.3. The last row of Table 3.2 is similar, and exhibits the economy under both Economyequalization AV and Economy equalization V of order 2.53.0 billion EURO.This eciency estimate is certainly conditional. However, the order of economy comparable with the total budget is very unlikely due to the model inaccuracies only. It ratherindicates at the really underused potential of the subsidies. Consequently, the situationcan be improved by either making the grants work with a full eciency, or by saving aconsiderable fraction of the grants.Chapter 4Conclusion 4.1 Further perspectives A natural way of improving the model is explaining the regional unemployment as afunction of subsidies 2.2 on the basis of longer control periods.It will improve theprediction accuracy of the model which is important for future planning.Next, some more elaborated restrictions can be imposed, with regard to the size oflocalities, industries, and social factors.Finally, some weight coecients can be introduces into the model to recid:176ect certainpolicy priorities.The variance operator from Theorem 1 reduces computing the variance to a vectormatrix multiplication. This means that the restrictions and the prediction of thenet unemployment can be arbitrarily complex, but if they are linear then the optimization problem is linearquadratic and, consequently, solvable.4.2 Recapitulation 1. The model developed contributes to equalizing the regional unemployment by optimally distributing the subsidies granted.2. The difierence between actual and optimized flgures show that, most likely, thepotential of active labor market policies is far from being exhausted.3. In particular, it explains low eciency of active labor market policies observed inempirical studies.4. The methods suggested are aimed at the optimal use of European and nationalgrants. Alternatively, policy goals can be attained with a more moderate budget,saving money for other purposes.5. Econometric decision models of this type can be developed further to improve theperformance of active labor market policies, implying socioeconomical and politicaladvantages.4546CHAPTER 4.
