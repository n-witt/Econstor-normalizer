Any errors are mine.1 Motivation Many central banks around the globe maintain objectives for longrun inflation between 1 and 3percent per year.1 However, many academics in the field of monetary economics identify a verydifferent range for optimal longrun inflation, namely from minus the real interest rate to zero.2These opposing views leave plenty of room for disagreement, and the recent nosedive in nominalshortterm interest rates has moved the debate about the optimal rate of longrun inflation tocenter stage.In this paper, I analyze optimal longrun inflation under plausible assumptions about firmlevel productivity dynamics, and make a case for moderately positive longrun inflation. In firmlevel data, firms move systematically through the productivity distribution over time. Firmstend to have belowaverage productivity upon market entry and they tend to experience postentry growth in productivity through learning by doing, economies of scale, process innovation,or through changes in their product mix.I consider a New Keynesian model with firm turnover and growth in firmspecific productivityFIP to capture the firmlevel productivity dynamics observed in the data. In the FIP model,a firm enters the market with belowaverage productivity, and the firms productivity grows atconstant rate over time. The firm sets the optimal price for its product upon entry and resetsthe price infrequently in subsequent periods. The FIP model nests the basic New Keynesianmodel with homogenous productivity HOP as a special case.My analysis delivers two main results. The first result is that optimal longrun inflation inthe FIP model is positive and equal to growth in firmspecific productivity. This result emergesfrom the planner problem associated with the FIP model. In contrast, it is well known that, inthe HOP model, optimal longrun inflation is zero. Zero longrun inflation allows firms in the HOP model to maintain the flexibleprice markup at all times despite sticky nominal prices.Moreover, at zero longrun inflation, there is no dispersion in relative prices because firms donot benefit from changing their price at the flexibleprice markup.The FIP model overturns the zeroinflation pricestability result that is so prominent inthe literature. In the FIP model, positive rather than zero longrun inflation is required for firmsto maintain the flexibleprice markup. Growth in firmspecific productivity induces a firms realmarginal costs to decline. Accordingly, for the firm to maintain the flexibleprice markup, its real 1See Kuttner 2004, table 2, and SchmittGrohe and Uribe 2010, table 1.2See SchmittGrohe and Uribe 2010.1price also must decline. It requires positive longrun inflation equal to growth in firmspecificproductivity to convert sticky nominal prices into declining real prices.The second result of my analysis concerns macro dynamics and the central banks optimalstabilization of aggregate shocks. In order to analyze these dimensions, I linearize the FIP andthe HOP models at their respective efficient flexibleprice steady states. The second result is thatboth linearized models are observationally equivalent if the slope of the approximate Phillipscurve is parameterized directly. Observational equivalence implies that both models generatethe same impulseresponse functions, and the same decomposition of macro data into aggregateshocks. It also follows from observational equivalence that the conditions for a determinate localequilibrium coincide across models. A prominent example is the Taylor principle, which requiresthat, for the equilibrium to be determinate, the central bank has to move the nominal interestrate more than oneforone with inflation.Observational equivalence extends to the central banks optimal stabilization of shocks, andthis result does not depend on whether the central bank acts with discretion or commitment.Optimal stabilization policies are the same across models because the welfarebased loss function of the central bank, derived as secondorder expansion to the utility of the representativehousehold, is the same in the FIP and in the HOP model. Accordingly, any linearquadraticpolicy problem derived from either model, with the welfarebased loss function as the objectiveand equilibrium conditions as constraints, delivers the same optimal stabilization policy. Theequivalence of optimal stabilization policies is consistent with the fact that optimal longruninflation is distinct in the two models. Whereas the central bank in the FIP model stabilizesactual inflation around positive longrun inflation, the central bank in the HOP model stabilizesactual inflation around zero longrun inflation.This paper is related to a comprehensive literature on optimal longrun inflation. In viewof this literature, the papers original contribution is to highlight the consequences of firmlevelproductivity dynamics for optimal longrun inflation. Thus, the main feature of my analysis isheterogenous productivity across firms, whereas the benchmark model in the literature featureshomogenous productivity across firms.A prominent strand in the literature on longrun inflation finds that zero or negative longrun inflation is optimal. Goodfriend and King 2001 analyze the baseline model of the New Neoclassical Synthesis and make a case for longrun inflation near zero. Khan, King, and Wolman2003, Amano, Moran, Murchison, and Rennison 2009, and Aruoba and Schorfheide 20092find that longrun deflation between 0.5 and 2.5 percent per year is optimal. Khan, King, and Wolman 2003 use a model with four distortions that arise from staggered pricing, pricecostmarkups, shopping time, and money that is required for transactions. Amano, Moran, Murchison,and Rennison 2009 use a model with aggregate productivity growth. Aruoba and Schorfheide2009 use a twosector model with searchbased microfounded money demand. SchmittGroheand Uribe 2010 review main determinants of longrun inflation and conclude that optimallongrun inflation ranges from minus the real interest rate to zero. In contrast, this paper findspositive longrun inflation in a modified model of the New Neoclassical Synthesis.A second strand in the literature emphasizes aggregate factors that imply positive longruninflation while this paper emphasizes firmspecific factors that imply positive longrun inflation.Kim and RugeMurcia 2009 find that longrun inflation of 1.2 percent per year overcomesdownwardly rigid nominal wages. Billi forthcoming and Coibion, Gorodnichenko, and Wieland2010 account for the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates. Billi forthcoming finds thatoptimal longrun inflation is near 1 percent per year or close to 17 percent per year, dependingon whether the central bank acts under commitment or discretion. Coibion, Gorodnichenko, and Wieland 2010 find that optimal longrun inflation is positive but less than 2 percent per yearfor various regimes of monetary policy.In a related paper, Wolman 2009 studies longrun inflation in a twosector model withsticky prices and sectorspecific productivity growth. Productivity in each sector grows at itsown rate, whereas real wages grow at the same rate in both sectors. In this model, the centralbank cannot stabilize markups in both sectors at the same time, and mild deflation turns out tominimize social loss. My analysis highlights a different mechanism in that productivity growthremains identical across firms. Therefore, the central bank can stabilize all markups at the sametime.This paper is also related to the recent literature on the impact of longrun inflation onmacro dynamics and optimal stabilization policies. A main assumption in this literature is thatthe positive inflation objectives observed in the real world are suboptimal. Ascari 2004, Hornstein and Wolman 2005, Ascari and Ropele 2007, Kiley 2007, Ascari and Ropele 2009, and Kobayashi and Muto 2010 adopt this assumption in New Keynesian models with homogenousproductivity and show that the level of longrun inflation affects the plausibility of assumptions about how firms set prices, about the dynamics of macro variables, about determinacyproperties of monetarypolicy rules, and about optimal monetarypolicy responses to shocks. A3broad conclusion in this literature is that neither positive nor normative predictions of the New Keynesian model linearized at zero longrun inflation extrapolate to the realistic case of positivelongrun inflation.In contrast, a main result of my analysis is that the positive inflation objectives observed inthe real world are close to optimal. This finding conflicts with the assumption that positiveinflation objectives are suboptimal. Moreover, by observational equivalence with respect to thelinearized HOP model, the linearized FIP model warrants extrapolating both positive and normative predictions of the basic New Keynesian model linearized at zero longrun inflation to therealistic case of positive longrun inflation.The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews existing evidence on firmsproductivity dynamics and describes the model used in this paper. Section 3 analyzes the optimalrate of longrun inflation, and Section 4 presents the calibration. Output effects of suboptimallongrun inflation are quantified in Section 5. Section 6 describes macro dynamics and the centralbanks optimal reaction to shocks. The observational equivalence of linearized models requiresthat the slope of the linearized Phillips curve is parameterized directly, and I argue below thatthis is a reasonable precondition. As robustness check, Section 7 considers the case when thisslope is computed from structural parameters. Section 8 concludes.2 Model This section describes a model with growth in firmspecific productivity and with firm turnoverthat captures firms productivity dynamics observed in the data. A special case of the model isthe basic New Keynesian model without growth in firmspecific productivity and without firmturnover as in Clarida, Gali, and Gertler 1999, Woodford 2003, chapter 3, and Gali 2008,chapter 3. Before turning to the model, I briefly review the evidence on firms productivitydynamics to motivate the model setup.I split the evidence on firms productivity dynamics into productivity differentials betweennew and incumbent firms and into postentry growth of firms. The evidence on productivity differentials between new and incumbent firms suggests that new firms or new plants have 75 to 95percent of the productivity of incumbents.3 Productivity differentials of this magnitude reemergeacross different time periods and across countries. Among others, Baily, Hulten, Campbell, Bres3Geroski 1995, Caves 1998, and Bartelsman and Doms 2000 survey evidence from longitudinal microdata.4nahan, and Caves 1992, Baldwin 1996, Foster, Haltiwanger, and Krizan 2001, Aw, Chen,and Roberts 2001, Farias and Ruano 2005, Baldwin and Gu 2006 and Wagner 2010a examine productivity differentials in manufacturing. Foster, Haltiwanger, and Krizan 2001 alsoexamine services.The evidence on the postentry productivity growth of firms or plants suggests that theproductivity of surviving entrants grows between 2 and 3 percent per year. Thus, within adecade or so, the productivity of a new firm grows to a level similar to average productivity.Baily, Hulten, Campbell, Bresnahan, and Caves 1992 show that US manufacturing plants thatwere established between 1972 and 1977 and that were initially of belowaverage productivityattained aboveaverage productivity by 1987. Foster, Haltiwanger, and Krizan 2001 estimateshow that the productivity of US manufacturing firms grows at 2 percent per year. Huergo and Jaumandreu 2004 estimate that the productivity of Spanish manufacturing firms grows at 3percent per year. Baldwin and Gu 2006 estimate that productivity of Canadian manufacturingfirms grows at roughly 2 percent per year. The remainder of this section describes a model thatis consistent with this evidence.2.1 Firms Firms are indexed by j 0, 1, and each firm produces a single product variety. As in Ghironiand Melitz 2005, I thus treat a firm as a production line for this particular variety. Thetechnology of firm j needed to produce output yjt isyjt atgsjtcid:96jt .Productivity growth g 1 is common to all firms and independent of firm size. That firmgrowth is independent of firm size is Gibrats law and a first approximation to the data. Theinteger variable sjt 0, 1, 2, . . . indicates the firms age since market entry, and a new firm hassjt 0. When g equals unity, all firms are equally productive, as in the basic New Keynesianmodel. When g exceeds unity, established firms are more productive than young firms, as in themodel used in Melitz 2003. The unique production input cid:96jt is labor, which the firm hires in aperfectlycompetitive market. Aggregate productivity at is a stationary stochastic process withmean a 0. Growth in at is distinct from growth in firmspecific productivity and does notaffect conclusions.5The assumption that firms achieve productivity gains mechanically over time reflects thatthe longer a firm uses its technology, the more efficient is its production. In reality, efficiencygains may occur through learning by doing, economies of scale, process innovation, or changesin the product mix of a background firm.Firms enter and exit the economy in each period. At the beginning of a period, 0, 1new firms enter the economy. At the end of a period, firms exit the economy. Exiting firmsare selected randomly.4 Accordingly, firms with high and low levels of productivity are equallyexposed to exit. In reality, exit of a firm with high productivity may occur because of a majorshift in consumer taste, new regulation, or product liability; because the firms market share istaken over by a new firm which produces a close substitute; or because the firm starts exportingand stops selling in the home market. Baily, Hulten, Campbell, Bresnahan, and Caves 1992 findthat highly productive firms frequently exit at the industry level because they switch to differentindustries to optimize their product mix. Bernard, Redding, and Schott 2010 analyze theproductswitching activities of US manufacturing firms and find that product switching enhancesfirms efficiency. Along these lines, my assumption of nonselective exit is best interpreted ascapturing both firms that switch industries and firms that die.When a new firm enters the economy, it sets a price for its product. In subsequent periods,the firm resets its price with probability 1 , 0, 1, each period until the firm exits themarket. Firm j chooses its nominal price Pjt to solvemax Pjt Eti t,ti Pjtyjti Wticid:96jticid:88yjti PjtPti ytii0yjti atigsjticid:96jti .Here, i t,ti discounts nominal payoffs and 1 is the probability to produce tomorrowat old prices. The first constraint is demand for product j derived below, where P , W , and ydenote aggregate price level, nominal wage and aggregate output, respectively.5 The optimal 4In related work Weber unpublished, I confirm that optimal longrun inflation is positive and equal togrowth in firmspecific productivity in a version of this model with endogenous firm entry as in Bilbiie, Ghironi,and Melitz 2008 and Bilbiie, Ghironi, and Melitz 2010. However, endogenous firm entry requires one additionalstate variable to capture the dynamics of the number of firms. This state variable is absent in the basic New Keynesian model such that, by construction, the basic model cannot be observationally equivalent to models withendogenous entry. While endogenous firm entry is interesting it is not the main focus of this paper.5It is a common assumption in models with heterogenous firms such as Melitz 2003 and Ghironi and Melitz2005 that wages are identical across firms.6price equates the expected discounted sum of marginal revenues to the expected discounted sumof marginal costs. Once rearranged, this price satisfiescid:80cid:80jt gsjt P cid:63 1Eti0gi t,ti P ti ytiati Wti Eti0i t,ti P tiyti.1Here, I write sjti as i sjt because both a firms age sjt and index i are integers. The discountingeffect of productivity growth g on the righthand side indicates that, in future periods, higherproductivity reduces marginal costs. Crucially, the righthand side is independent of the firmindex j.Firms differ along two dimensions, the level of productivity and the date of the last pricechange length of price spell. Both dimensions affect the optimal price 1. According to 1,firms maintain the same optimal price if they are identical along both dimensions. For aggregation, I replace firm index j by two new indices each representing one dimension of heterogeneity.One index refers to date of entry, whereas the other index refers to date of last price change.Denote the current price Pjt of firm j as Pjt P cid:63tnk,tk , n 0, 1, 2, . . . , k 0, 1, 2, . . . .Accounting for the date of entry, Pjt equals either the optimal price of the current period orthe optimal price of some previous period. The first subscript t n k indicates the date ofmarket entry. The second subscript t k indicates the date of the last price change. Index ndenotes the time between entry and price change.It follows from pricing equation 1 that, for any two firms j and jcid:48, optimal time t pricesare proportional:jt gsjcid:48tsjt P cid:63P cid:63jcid:48t .Let j denote the young firm, sjcid:48t sjt, such that sjcid:48t sjt is a positive integer. The equationstates that the price of the young firm exceeds the price of the old firm if g 1. Specifically, letfirm j be of age k and have a price spell of k periods. Let firm jcid:48 be of age n k and have atnk,tk . Optimal prices are proportional butprice spell of k periods. Then, P cid:63tk,tk gn P cid:63not equal because the old firm is more productive and hence maintains a lower price.72.2 Households There are a large number of identical households.

Productivity dispersion remains constant over timebecause firm turnover is constant. Price dispersion varies over time because firms set pricesdepending on the timevarying state of the economy. Moreover, price dispersion is partly drivenby productivity dispersion. In Yun 2005, t is driven by price dispersion only, and pricedispersion arises exclusively from staggered pricing. Going through steps analogous to thoseused when deriving a recursive expression for the price level yieldst n1 pcid:63t gt t 1 .5Appendix A summarizes the equilibrium conditions of the competitive economy with stickyprices. In what follows, I frequently compare the FIP and the HOP models. This comparisoninvolves changing two parameters, productivity growth g and the rate of firm turnover . However, to highlight the role of g, I keep unchanged throughout. Thus, I compare two modelswith firm turnover, one with homogenous productivity and one with firmspecific productivity.The firmturnover model with homogenous productivity is equal to the basic model withoutfirm turnover once I interpret 1 rather than as the probability that a firm cannotadjusts its price. This interpretation constitutes a useful reference.3 Analyzing Optimal LongRun Inflation The goal of this section is to determine the rate of longrun inflation that reconciles the steadystate of the stickyprice model with the steady state of the efficient flexibleprice model. Thisinflation rate is of interest in itself and because the stickyprice model is typically linearized at theefficient flexibleprice steady state, and I shall treat the FIP model accordingly.6 I start by solving 6Woodford 2003, chapter 6 and 7, discusses several reasons for pursuing this approach. First, a compactand intuitive way to understand the goals of welfaremaximizing monetary policy is to express the stickypricemodel as a deviation from its corresponding flexibleprice model. For this to be feasible, both models need tobe linearized at the same steady state. Second, for the loss function accurate to second order to appropriatelyrank different policies based on a model accurate to first order, firstorder terms must not appear in this lossfunction. One approach to ensure this is to expand utility near the efficient allocation. Third, in order to be ableto assess the policies of interest accurately enough, these policies have to imply that model variables remain near 10the planner problem of the model described so far for the efficient allocation. Then, I reconcilethe flexibleprice competitive equilibrium with the efficient allocation. Finally, I reconcile thestickyprice competitive equilibrium with the efficient flexibleprice competitive equilibrium. Allthe derivations are valid for g 1 and encompass the HOP model as a special case.In the HOP model, two distortions push the stickyprice economy away from the efficientallocation: monopolistic competition among price setters and the fact that not all product pricesadjust each period such that relative prices are potentially distorted. A labor tax is sufficientto offset the distortion from monopolistic competition, and zero longrun inflation copes withdistortions in relative prices. As it turns out, in the FIP model, the same labor tax offsets thedistortion from monopolistic competition, whereas positive rather than zero longrun inflationis required to account for distortions in relative prices.3.1 Planner Equilibrium I divide the solution of the planner equilibrium PE into two stages. The first stage determinesthe efficient allocation of labor across firms and aggregate technology that links aggregate outputto aggregate labor. The second stage resolves the tradeoff between work and consumption. Itis necessary to consider the first stage upfront because, with productivity growth g 1, firmsare heterogenous. The twostage planning problem resembles the twostage consumer problemin the competitive equilibrium CE.Aggregate Technology.

One may guess and later verify that policies close to theefficient allocation fulfill this requirement.11Figure 1: Distribution of relative quantities and relative prices consistent with the efficient allocation.

The output shifter 1e summarizes two effects. First, there is output lossbecause goods are produced in different quantities. Second, there is output gain because firmsbecome more productive over time.12051015202530354011.52ageyj y Distribution of relative quantities 05101520253035400.850.90.9511.051.1agepj Distribution of relative pricesFigure 1 plots the distribution of relative output yet as a function of a firms age sjt. Forg 1, distribution is uniform because all firms maintain the same technology and consumersjtyederive the greatest value from aggregate consumption when products enter the composite in equalamounts. For g 1, the planner faces a tradeoff because firms maintain different technologies.The planner has to trade off between a symmetric allocation of products favored by consumersand the fact that established products are produced more effectively than young products. Theoptimal resolution of this tradeoff is the distribution of relative quantities in Figure 1. Youngfirms produce belowaverage output and established firms produce aboveaverage output.Tradeoff between Labor and Consumption.

To sum up, the PE consists of the two equationst hcid:96cid:96euccet ate ,t qt atcid:96etceeand the output shifter 1e in equation 6.73.2 Competitive Equilibrium with Flexible Prices Here, I derive the labor tax that reconciles the flexibleprice CE with the PE.

It consists ofthe two equations1 L1 1hcid:96cid:96ft uccft atft,t qt atcid:96fcftft.8ftis the special case of equation 5 with flexible prices 0. By this equation, the outputshifter in the flexibleprice CE is constant and equal to the output shifter in the PE:ft e .13The finding suggests that the inefficiency from monopoly power does not distort the allocationof labor across firms in the flexibleprice CE because monopoly power is the same across firms.To show that this is indeed true, consider first the allocation of labor across firms in theflexibleprice CE. Combine household demand and technology of product j to obtain cid:96fa 1t gsjtP f cid:63section recursion of prices derived from pricing equation 1 to obtainjt t .

Moreover, this subsidy is the same in the FIP and the HOPmodel because decentralization does not distort the crosssection allocation of labor.3.3 Competitive Equilibrium with Sticky Prices I now determine the longrun inflation rate that reconciles the steady state of the stickyprice CE with the steady state of the flexibleprice CE. The FIP model with sticky prices exhibitsa welldefined aggregate steady state in which aggregate variables do not grow.7 This is truedespite the fact that firmspecific productivity grows at a positive rate because two polar forces,an expanding force and a contracting force, balance each other. The expanding force is growthin firmspecific productivity, which induces output of the average firm per cohort to grow. Thecontracting force is firm turnover. Exiting firms are randomly drawn such that the sample ofexiting firms replicates the productivity distribution of the firm population. However, exiting 7By aggregate steady state I mean that aggregate shocks at and qt are equal to their unconditional means,whereas both idiosyncratic shocks, firm exit and Calvo lottery, continue to operate. Steadystate output remainsconstant under two standard assumptions. First, aggregate labor does not grow cid:96t cid:96. Second, the centralbank ensures constant longrun inflation t . Without loss of generality, I also assume that both exogenousprocesses at and qt are stationary. Constant inflation implies a constant relative price of new firms pcid:63 by equation4. Constant inflation and constant relative price imply by equation 5 that the output shifter 1 remainsconstant. Using aggregate technology, it follows then that output is constant. See Appendix B for further details.14firms are replaced by new firms with low productivity.The following three equations are derived from the CE with sticky prices in Appendix B anddetermine steadystate levels of , c, cid:96 conditional on :11e cid:19 1cid:181 gcid:181 1cid:19cid:18 1 g 1cid:19 11cid:181 g 1 11 g 11 L1 1hcid:96cid:96ucc ae 1 g 11 1c q acid:96 .cid:1991011There are two distortions from inflation that do not arise in the flexibleprice CE in equations 8. First, in equation 9, inflation alters the output shifter 1 in the stickyprice CErelative to 1e. Second, in equation 10, inflation distorts the marginal rates of transformationand substitution. This distortion is unrelated to the wedge from monopolistic competition 1 which also exists in the flexibleprice CE and can be eliminated by imposing L esummarize the first main result of the paper in the following proposition.L. IProposition 1: Longrun inflation equal to growth in firmspecific productivity g and thelabor tax L e L reconcile the stickyprice CE with the efficient flexibleprice CE.To prove this claim, evaluate equations 911 at g and L e L to obtain e ,hcid:96cid:96ucc ae ,c q acid:96e .Comparing these equations to the efficient flexibleprice CE in steady state shows that geliminates both distortions from longrun inflation. This completes the proof.It is instructive to consider each distortion from inflation in greater detail to understandwhy this particular inflation rate restores efficiency. I start with the distortion between marginalrates of transformation and substitution. A related analysis for the HOP model is contained in Goodfriend and King 1998 and King and Wolman 1999.15Figure 2: Average markup and output shifter relative to efficient output shifter 11e plotted as afunction of longrun inflation. Longrun inflation is annualized. Thick lines correspond to the FIP model withg 1.0314. Thin lines correspond to the HOP model with g 1. Dashed line corresponds to static markup 1 .Average Markup It is straightforward to map the distortion between marginal rates of transformation and substitution into the average markup. Define the average markup as the inverse of real marginalcosts of a firm with average efficient productivity, awe.

The average markupcoincides with the static markup 1 for longrun inflation equal to g. The average markupexceeds the static markup for longrun inflation below g, is minimal for some longrun inflationslightly above g, and exceeds the static markup again when longrun inflation exceeds g.1611.021.041.061.2981.31.3021.3041.3061.3081.311.3121.3141.3161.31811.021.041.060.9840.9860.9880.990.9920.9940.9960.99811 1eTwo effects impinge on the average markup and generate this behavior. The anticipatedinflation effect works through firms that do adjust their price and dominates the average markupfor longrun inflation above g. The passthrough effect works through firms that do not adjusttheir price and dominates the average markup for longrun inflation below g. The anticipatedinflation effect is best described by using the pricing equation 1. The passthrough effect isbest described by using the price level 3. Jointly, both equations imply equation 12.Consider the anticipatedinflation effect first. For a new firm, the steadystate pricing equation can be rearranged as 0 iicid:88i0cid:20 pcid:63i 1cid:21.wagi13The square brackets contain the difference between the optimal real price pcid:63i and the desiredreal price 1 wagi, which is equal to the static markup over marginal costs. Over time, thedifference between the optimal real price and the desired real price evolves depending on thevalue of relative to g. If equals g then pcid:63i is equal to the desired price each and everyperiod. Thus, inflation equal to g erodes pcid:63 at exactly the right pace for the firm to maintainthe static markup.8 However, if exceeds g then pcid:63 is eroded faster than marginal costs decline,and future markups are compressed to below the static markup. Firms choose elevated markupsin initial periods to counterbalance markup compression in future periods. Thus, with aboveg, elevated markups of adjusting firms lift the current average markup in Figure 2.In equation 13, anticipated inflation also implies that future differences between the optimaland the desired price are weighted more because i enters the discount factor. I refer to this asthe marketshare effect. With inflation, pcid:63i declines over time and increases the firms marketshare. When the market share is high, any difference between the optimal and the desired pricereduces profits greatly. Accordingly, the higher trend inflation is, the more the firm is concernedwith getting its price right in future periods. However, the marketshare effect alone does notprevent pcid:63i from being equal to the desired price in each period.Consider now the passthrough effect that captures by how much the markup of a new firmmoves the average markup. Define the markup of a new firm or the marginal markup cid:638The FIP model suggests a simple rationale for firms not to index prices to inflation. Namely, inflation erodesprices in line with growth in firmspecific productivity.17as P cid:63t,t Wta.

Suppose 1 and g 1 such that passthroughof cid:63 into is excessively high. Absent inflation, markups of many incumbent firms are abovethe static markup because their real marginal costs declined whereas their real prices remainedconstant. Accordingly, these firms produce insufficient amount of output and, thereby, receivetoo little weight in the average markup that weights a firms markup by its relative output.In contrast, firms with the marginal markup overproduce and receive too much weight in theaverage markup. Vice versa, when 1 and g 1, passthrough of of cid:63 into is insufficientbecause firms with the marginal markup receive too little weight in the average markup.Productivity and PriceDispersion The second distortion created by longrun inflation in the CE with sticky prices arises fromproductivity and pricedispersion. The left panel of Figure 2 plots 1 over 1e in equation9 as a function of inflation. The efficient shifter 1e indicates the amount of dispersion thatis indispensable because firms productivity differs. The plot shows that most levels of inflationcreate excess dispersion in relative prices and, by product demand yjty Pjt Pt, in relativequantities. Excess dispersion in relative quantities reduces the enduse value of output becauseconsumers prefer evenly distributed products. Excess dispersion arises whenever inflation is notequal to productivity growth cid:54 g. In this case, firms do not manage to maintain the static 9Substituting equation 14 for the marginal markup again delivers equation 12.18markup while keeping their nominal price fixed. Accordingly, firms reset prices whenever feasible.Reset prices disperse relative prices because only a subset of prices is adjusted each period.If inflation is equal to g, however, firms do maintain the static markup while keeping theirnominal price fixed.10 In this case, price stickiness imposes no constraint on firms because firmsdo not benefit from changing their price in the first place, and the distribution of relative pricesresembles the one in the flexibleprice CE. That is, if the central bank supports firms to maintainthe static markup, at the same time, it minimizes dispersion in relative quantities. One policyinstrument eliminates both distortions, and staggered pricing entails no social costs.4 Calibration A core parameter of this analysis is growth in firmspecific productivity g. I set firmspecificproductivity growth to 3 percent per year or, taking one period as a quarter, to g 1.0314.This value is in line with the evidence on postentry productivity growth discussed in Section 2.To see what this value implies for the productivity differential between new and incumbent firms,I derive the productivity distribution implied by the model. Rather than moving straight to theproductivity distribution, it is useful to briefly consider the age distribution of firms. The agedistribution is Js 1 s, with s denoting age in quarters. The productivity distributionhas discrete support because productivity s gs grows with age s, and age is discrete. Theinverse of s is s ln lng. Plug this expression into the age distribution to obtainthe productivity distribution Js or J 1 ln lng .It holds thatcid:80 J 1 for all s gs and s 0, 1, . . . .I compute the productivity differential between new firms and the average incumbent firmfrom J. At g 1.0314, the productivity of a new firm is 94.26 percent the productivity of theaverage incumbent firm. In light of the evidence reviewed in Section 2, a productivity differentialof below 6 percent is at the very conservative end of the spectrum of estimates. Figure 3 plotsthe productivity distribution. For illustration, the figure contains two productivity distributions,one with g 1.0314 crosses, and one with g 1.0114 dots. Circles indicate the mean level 10Longrun inflation equal to g maximizes the ratio 11e , and the maximal value of this ratio is unity. Thus,there is no way to compress 1 to above its efficient level by means of inflation.19Figure 3: Productivity distribution J under the benchmark calibration g 1.0314 crosses and under thealternative calibration g 1.0114 dots. Circles indicate the levels of productivity closest to the mean of thedistribution.of productivity. Evidently, the mean and dispersion increase in g, keeping the level of entryproductivity constant. Young firms have belowaverage productivity and established firms haveaboveaverage productivity.One alternative way to assess the calibration of g is to compute productivity differentials fromestimated Pareto distributions that describe the productivity distribution in firmlevel data well.To obtain the productivity differential in the Pareto case, suppose that the higher productivity is, the more established the firms are. Then, the productivity of a new firm is equal to thecutoff parameter min, and the average productivity is equal to E kmink 1, with 2011.11.21.31.41.500.010.020.030.040.050.060.070.08Productivity distributionPareto index k cid:54 1.11 The productivity differential ismin E k 1k.Del Gatto, Mion, and Ottaviano 2006 estimate k close to 2 for the manufacturing sectorsof 11 European countries. This value implies a productivity differential of 50 percent. Ghironiand Melitz 2005 calibrate k to 3.4 for a twocountry model with endogenous entry into exportmarkets.12 In my setting, this value would imply a productivity differential of 29 percent. Overall,my calibration of g implies a very moderate productivity differential.The remaining parameters are calibrated as follows. The flexibleprice or static markup is 30 percent. This markup implies 4 11996. Efficiency of the steady state requires subsidizing labor at rate e 3, a value similar to the value used by King and Wolman L 0.3. The probability of not adjusting the price is 0.8059. The rate of product turnover is equal to 0.0694, whichcorresponds to the 25 percent product turnover per year reported in Broda and Weinstein 2010.Thus, 1 is equal to 0.75 such that the mean duration of a price spell in the censoreddistribution of prices is equal to four quarters. The discount factor is set to 0.995. Period utilityis parameterized as uc c 11 11 1 and hcid:96 cid:9611 . I set equal tounity, which corresponds to the logutility of consumption. The laborsupply elasticity is equalto 0.25. Then, the slope of the Phillips curve is equal to 0.1061 in the FIP model and equal to 0.1269 in the HOP model.13 The ratio of government consumption over output sq qy is 0.2,and 3 implies steadystate labor close to 0.5.5 Output Effects of LongRun Inflation In order to illustrate the output effects of longrun inflation in the FIP model, I solve equations9 to 11 for the function y y. Figure 4 plots the function for the benchmark calibration.In the FIP model thick line, output increases with longrun inflation as long as inflation is zero 11Discrete J can be connected to the continuous Pareto distribution f by deriving parameters k andmin, such that J f for all gs. However, it is misleading to interpret parameters obtained in such away in light of the empirical data because f differ from J. The difference is that the mass of J is not evenlyspread over the continuous support of f because the values of grow exponentially and thus are not equidistant.12Firms that enter export markets usually have higher productivity than firms that do not. This does notcontradict the observation that new exporters tend to have lower productivity than incumbent exporters. Indeed,for West Germany, Wagner 2010b shows that new exporters are less productive than incumbent exporters butare more productive than nonexporters Table 3.13For robustness, I also consider equal to 6.25, which is the value used in Woodford 2003, Table 6.1. Thisvalue implies that is equal to 0.0318 in the FIP model and is equal to 0.0381 in the HOP model, which is inline with estimates in Cecioni 2010 or Altig, Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Linde undated.21Figure 4: Output as a function of longrun inflation in the FIP model and the HOP model. Output is thepercentage deviation from the level of output when longrun inflation is zero. Longrun inflation is annualized.Thick line corresponds to FIP model with g 1.0314. Thin line corresponds HOP model with g 1.or moderately positive; the relationship inverts for high levels of longrun inflation. In the HOPmodel thin line, output falls for inflation to slightly above zero and higher.Quantitatively, the output effects of longrun inflation are moderate in the FIP model butlarge in the HOP model. In Figure 4, output in the FIP model falls by 0.27 percent when longrun inflation increases from zero to 8 percent per year, whereas output in the HOP model fallsby 1.24 percent. With equal to 8 rather than 4 13, output in the FIP model falls by 1.29 percent,whereas output in the HOP model falls by 3.92 percent when annual inflation increases fromzero to 8 percent. With equal to 6.25 rather than unity and equal to 4 13, output in the FIPmodel falls by 0.84 percent, whereas output in the HOP model falls by 3.74 percent. These largeoutput effects of longrun inflation in the HOP model are in line with results in Ascari 2004and Bakhshi, Khan, BurrielLlombart, and Rudolf 2007.It has been argued that the large output effects of longrun inflation in the HOP model are 220.9911.011.021.031.041.051.061.071.41.210.80.60.40.200.2Output effects of longrun inflation y FIPy HOPimplausible. They arise because positive inflation erodes sticky nominal prices. However, priceerosion provides a very strong incentive for firms to change their prices when longrun inflationexceeds certain levels.14 In the model of Levin and Yun 2007, firms select the frequency ofprice adjustment endogenously. Whereas moderate inflation implies a nontrivial reduction ofoutput in this model, this effect disappears at high inflation rates because firms decide to adjusttheir prices more often. In the model of Dotsey, King, and Wolman 1999 with statedependentpricing, positive longrun inflation makes it more likely that each firm will adjust its price ina given period. Moreover, it is more likely that firms with outdated prices will adjust, andthe maximum duration of price spells will be shortened endogenously. The HOP model withtimedependent Calvo pricing fails to capture these effects of longrun inflation.The output effects of positive longrun inflation are much more moderate and thus moreplausible in the FIP model than in the HOP model. In the FIP model, firms actually benefitfrom positive inflation being equal to growth in firmspecific productivity because this amountof price erosion enables firms to maintain the static markup at all times despite sticky nominalprices. One consequence of this is that, in the FIP model, Calvo pricing remains a parsimoniousbenchmark assumption for levels of longrun inflation consistent with the inflation objectives ofcentral banks in many industrialized economies.Clearly, most levels of inflation in Figure 4 lead to an inefficient steady state because g iskept constant while varies. For the inefficient steady state to exist, inflation cannot exceed g1. This upper bound ensures a finite optimal price pcid:63 in equation 1. For thebenchmark calibration, annual inflation above 31.31 percent conflicts with the upper bound.15The limit falls to 15.90 percent with equal to 8. Inflation rates above these values have beenextremely rare in industrialized economies in recent decades.In the FIP model, there is also an upper bound on longrun inflation in efficient steady statewhich is distinct from the bound in inefficient steady state. The additional bound arises becauseefficiency requires g, and g has to obey g 1 14 and guarantees new firms a positive market share. Appendix B provides further details. For 1 . This bound derives from equation 14Graham and Snower 2004 argue along these lines for the case of sticky wages. Kiley 2002 considers avariation of the theme, namely, that welfare costs of longrun inflation are much larger in a model with Calvopricing than in a model with Taylor pricing. One approach to mitigate the effects of inflation in steady state isprice indexation Yun 1996. Cogley and Sbordone 2008 argue that price indexation is not consistent withmicro data on prices.15The upper bound on inflation, which to some extent is an artefact of pure Calvo pricing, can be weakenedor entirely overcome by assuming endogenous price stickiness as in Bakhshi, Khan, BurrielLlombart, and Rudolf2007, by assuming pricing contracts as in Taylor 1980, or by assuming truncated Calvo pricing as in Amano,Ambler, and Rebei 2007.23my benchmark calibration, the upper bound on efficient longrun inflation is close to 9 percentper year, and encompasses the 3 percent efficient longrun inflation implied by this calibration.Whereas the upper bound on efficient longrun inflation is loose for intermediate values of , ittightens for high values of .16 High values of reduce the market share of new products becauseconsumers are more willing to substitute away from new products with a high relative price.Accordingly, when equals 8 rather than 4 13, the upper bound falls to 4.2 percent per year.However, this value still encompasses the estimate of efficient longrun inflation implied by the FIP model.Another way to assess the upper bound is to estimate efficient longrun inflation using averageinflation in the data. Fuhrer 2009, Table 2, reports averages for various measures of annual USinflation that all remain well below the upper bound of 9 percent for data from 1959 to 2008 andfor various subsamples. Moreover, the upper bound encompasses inflation rates, averaged bydecade, in major industrialized economies from the 1960s to present when exempting the highinflation episodes in the 1970s Bakhshi, Khan, BurrielLlombart, and Rudolf 2007, Table 2.6 Macro Dynamics and Monetary Stabilization Policy The second set of results concerns the dynamics of aggregate variables and the central banksoptimal reaction to aggregate shocks. In order to analyze these aspects, I consider the modelwith firmspecific productivity FIP and the model with homogenous productivity HOP wheneach model is linearized at its efficient flexibleprice steady state.6.1 Macro Dynamics A local equilibrium of the FIP model calculated to the first order is determined bycid:2 sc1cid:3yft Ett1 xtxt Etxt1 scit Ett1 rft t sc1sq qt 1 att Et1 L1yft sq qtscrf1616The evidence from models with firm turnover favors intermediate rather than high values of . Lewis and Poilly 2010 estimate equal to 3.31 in a monetary model with endogenous entry, a value similar to the oneestimated in Bernard, Eaton, Jensen, and Kortum 2003. Furthermore, entry barriers exist in the real worldeven though these barriers do not matter in the FIP model with exogenous firm turnover. Entry barriers arelikely to increase the markups of incumbent firms and thus support intermediate values of . Moreover, assumingdecreasing returns to scale in firms technology would push the upper bound outwards.24plus a specification of monetary policy. Variable x denotes the output gap y yf , and yf andrf denote the natural levels of output and the natural real rate, respectively. A hat on top ofa variables denotes percentage deviation from steady state, and L denotes the lag operator.The first equation is the New Keynesian Phillips Curve NKPC. The slope of the NKPC depends on and the structural parameters, 1 11 11 sc1 .17I suppose here and reconsider below that the slope of the NKPC is parameterized directlyand therefore remains the same across models. Thus, I obtain the following proposition.Proposition 2: Macro dynamics in the linearized FIP model and in the linearized HOP modelare observationally equivalent if the slope of the approximate New Keynesian Phillips Curve isparameterized directly.Recall that the FIP model nests the HOP model as the special case g, and thus , which is equalto unity. Accordingly, it is easy to verify from equations 16 and 17 that both linearized modelsare observationally equivalent if the slope of the NKPC is parameterized directly because allother parameters remain independent of either g or .Observational equivalence of linearized models emerges despite the fact that the FIP model isconsistent with the positive inflation objectives pursued by many central banks around the world,whereas the HOP model is not consistent with these objectives. It follows from the equivalenceresult that all the first and second moments of macro variables coincide across models. Forinstance, both models imply the same impulseresponse functions, and both models decomposemacro timeseries into exactly the same sequences of aggregate shocks. Accordingly, both modelssuggest the same positive interpretation of historic episodes in light of these shocks.Equivalence further implies that conditions for the equilibrium to be unique coincide acrossmodels. One such condition for the case when monetary policy follows the rule it f t fxxtis the Taylor principle. Roughly speaking, the Taylor principle states that f should exceedunity. More precisely, as Bullard and Mitra 2002 show in their proposition 1, the conditionf 1 1 fx 0 ensures uniqueness in the model, as summarized by equations 16.Accordingly, the Taylor principle ensures determinacy in both models.The equivalence result is in contrast with previous findings in the literature. First, Ascari 252004 shows that macro dynamics of the basic New Keynesian model with Calvo pricing changedramatically if the model is linearized at positive rather than zero inflation.17 He concludes thatit is not appropriate to compare data simulated from the model linearized at zero inflationwith actual data characterized by positive average inflation. According to my analysis, sucha comparison is appropriate as long as it can be convincingly argued that average inflationapproximates efficient longrun inflation in the FIP model reasonably well. Second, Kiley 2007and Ascari and Ropele 2009 show that determinacy conditions in the basic New Keynesianmodel with Taylor pricing Kiley or Calvo pricing Ascari and Ropele are sensitive to longruninflation. Most prominently, the Taylor principle no longer guarantees determinacy at moderatelypositive longrun inflation. My analysis does not support this claim.A main assumption underlying my proposition 2 is that the slope of the NKPC remainsthe same in the FIP and the HOP model. This assumption is reasonable because both modelsdeliver exactly the same slope estimate if the slope is estimated from either model by meansof macro data, as it is done frequently in the literature. A similar situation arises in Altig,Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Linde undated who study a model with firmspecific capital anda nested model with homogenous capital and exploit observational equivalence across modelsto obtain a better match between macro and micro evidence on the duration of price spells.18One alternative to assuming that is the same across models is to compute from calibratedstructural parameters. In this case, the two models do make different predictions because differs across models and depends on . In Section 7, I trace out these differences, which turnout to be small.6.2 Monetary Stabilization Policy In order to assess the central banks optimal reaction to shocks, I derive the welfarebased lossfunction of the central bank as a secondorder expansion to the utility of the representativehousehold in the FIP and the HOP model.Proposition 3: The welfarebased loss function L calculated to the second order is proportional 17A similar finding emerges in Hornstein and Wolman 2005 for a model with firmspecific capital and pricesetting according to Taylor 1980. Hornstein and Wolman also find a large impact of longrun inflation on thedeterminacy region of monetarypolicy rules.18Along similar lines, Appendix C derives micro implications of macro estimates of the slope of the Phillipscurve. There, I show that the FIP model mitigates the conflict that exists in the HOP model between micro dataon price durations and estimates of obtained from macro data.26tocid:88t0E0tcid:82t x 2tcid:9 .18It follows straight from the proposition that the welfarebased loss function is the samein the FIP and the HOP model if the slope of the NKPC is parameterized directly andtherefore remains the same across models. The reason for this is that longrun inflation mattersfor the welfare loss 18 only through this slope, which enters the relative weight attached tostabilizing the output gap. The weight is proportional to , and the factor of proportionality 1 is independent of longrun inflation.Equivalence of the approximate loss functions in the FIP and the HOP model implies thatthe central banks optimal reaction to shocks is identical in the two approximate models. Theoptimal reaction to shocks derives from a linearquadratic policy problem with objective 18,constraints 16, shock processes, and given initial conditions. Under the stated assumptions,all the components of this problem are the same in the approximate FIP and the approximate HOP model. Equivalence of optimal stabilization policies does not depend on assumptions aboutcentralbank commitment and extends to the optimal coefficients of simple policy rules.Ascari and Ropele 2007 analyze optimal stabilization policy in the basic New Keynesianmodel with Calvo pricing linearized at positive longrun inflation. They posit a loss function ofthe same form as equation 18 but treat the weight on stabilizing the output gap as a primitiveparameter. Here, I can relate this weight to structural parameters. Furthermore, a main resultin Ascari and Ropele 2007 is that optimal discretionary policy renders the equilibrium withpositive longrun inflation indeterminate.19 This result does not carry over to my analysis.Coibion, Gorodnichenko, and Wieland 2010 derive the welfarebased loss function calculated to the second order at a steady state with positive longrun inflation. They perform thesecalculations in a New Keynesian model with optimal longrun inflation equal to zero absentthe zero lower bound. They find that the weight attached to stabilizing inflation increases int x 219Ascari and Ropele minimize period loss 2t with 0 under discretion subject to their NKPC, whichcontains a costpush shock ut uut 1 t with t 0, 2 and u 0, 1. For positive longrun inflation,their NKPC also contains the expectation of an auxiliary variable. The law of motion of the auxiliary variable isentirely forwardlooking for their benchmark calibration. No such auxiliary variable enters the NKPC derived here.Accordingly, minimizing objective 18 subject to t Et t1 xt ut yields a determinate equilibriumas long as 0. Solution details are in Woodford 2003s proposition 7.5, or in Clarida, Gali, and Gertler1999, Section 3.27longrun inflation because the marginal disutility from price dispersion is increasing in longruninflation. My weight attached to stabilizing inflation does not display this effect because positivelongrun inflation equal to g in my model implies the efficient amount of price dispersion.6.3 Optimal LongRun Inflation Target The welfarebased loss function implies that optimal inflation targets are distinct in the FIP andthe HOP model even though the optimal reaction to shocks is identical in these models. Thisproperty of the loss function is similar to the fact that optimal longrun inflation is distinct inboth models.In order to show that optimal inflation targets differ across models, rearrange the definitiont logt as t t , which is calculated to the first order, and plug it into theperiod loss to obtaint 2 x 2t .19Inspecting this equation reveals that the central bank in the FIP model stabilizes actual inflationaround positive longrun inflation 1, whereas the central bank in the HOP model stabilizesactual inflation around zero longrun inflation 1.Ascari and Ropele 2007 assign a positive inflation target to the central bank in the basic New Keynesian model with homogenous productivity to analyze optimal stabilization policy.Accordingly, the central bank in their model pursues suboptimal longrun policy because theoptimal inflation target is zero rather than positive in this model. They motivate this assumptionwith the observation that inflation targets in the real world are often positive. In the FIP modelexamined here, it is actually optimal for the central bank to pursue a positive inflation target.Positive optimal inflation targets are rarely encountered in models of the New Neoclassical Synthesis that do not impose the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates. Woodford 2003,chapter 6, shows that zero target inflation remains a robust prediction, at least approximately,in many extensions of the basic model. Erceg and Levin 2006, Huang and Liu 2005, Benigno2004, and Aoki 2001 analyze cyclical variation in relative prices across sectors and show thatsuch variation justifies temporary, but not permanent, deviation from price stability.287 Flattening the Slope of the Phillips Curve The previous discussion assumes that the slope of the NKPC is parameterized directly. Thisassumption is plausible because a slope estimate obtained from macro data is the same regardlessof whether the linearized FIP or HOP model is employed for estimation. One alternative toestimation is to calibrate structural parameters underlying the slope using micro evidence. Inthis case, higher longrun inflation implies a flatter slope, and the two models do make differentpredictions. In this section, I trace out these differences. I start with the impact of longruninflation on the slope of the NKPC. Then, I compare macro dynamics under a simple monetarypolicy rule and assess welfare consequences of optimal stabilization policies.7.1 How LongRun Inflation Flattens the Phillips Curve In order to link longrun inflation and the slope of the NKPC , I look more closely intothe pricing equation 1 and into the inflation equation 4. Jointly, these equations imply the NKPC.Linearizing the pricing equation 1 at the efficient steady state deliverscid:88icid:21 scid:63cid:3 .t Etpcid:63ti ti1i0The discount rate increases in longrun inflation because increases in longrun inflation.This captures the marketshare effect in steady state. With positive longrun inflation, the firmsrelative price falls over time and future market shares increase. The firm anticipates high futuremarket shares and weights future price determinants more. The marketshare effect also impliesthat real marginal costs scid:63ti are weighted less and expected inflation ti1 is weighted more.Expected inflation is weighted more because it indicates more erosion of the firms price wheninflation is expected to be above trend.Inflation equation 4 pins down the relative market share of a new firm in steady state,pcid:631 1 1 g 1 .Increasing g reduces the market share of a new firm because increasing g boosts average productivity while the productivity of a new firm remains fixed. A small market share means that thelevel Pt cid:82 1optimal relative price of new firms pcid:63t has less impact on inflation because the aggregate price 0 Pjtcjtctdj weighs prices by relative quantities. The linearized inflation equation 29captures this effect:cid:181 cid:19pcid:63t .t The optimal price of new firms affects inflation less the higher is .Combining the pricing equation and the inflation equation yields the NKPC 16 with itsslope determined by equation 17. The higher longrun inflation is the smaller this slope isand the flatter the Phillips curve is. This happens for two reasons. First, firms set their priceswith greater emphasis on future price determinants because positive longrun inflation increasesfuture market shares. Second, with positive longrun inflation, the current market share of newfirms falls relative to the market share of the average firm.20 Therefore, inflation responds lesssensitively to the optimal price of new firms.7.2 Macro Dynamics How do changes in the slope of the NKPC that are triggered by longrun inflation affect macrodynamics? Figure 5 plots the dynamics of the output gap, inflation, and interest rates in the FIP model crosses and in the HOP model circles after a costpush shock of one percent.Monetary policy is the same across models, it f t fxxt with f 1.5 and fx 0.125 .Qualitatively, shock transmission is identical in both models. The shock increases inflation,and monetary policy responds by raising the nominal interest rate more than inflation. Elevatedreal rates encourage the household to postpone consumption such that stickyprice output falls.The output gap falls, too, because flexibleprice output remains unaffected by the shock. By the NKPC, the central bank partially stabilizes inflation through the drop in the output gap.Quantitatively, inflation and the output gap vary slightly more in the FIP model than in the HOP model. The equilibrium beyond the dynamics in Figure 5 is imposing 1 xtt f u 1 u1 u fx 1 f u1 u fx ut .The slope of the NKPC appears in the square brackets. For the moment, let u 0. A flatterslope increases the absolute responses of both inflation and the output gap to costpush shocksbecause the term in square brackets falls. It follows from the NKPC that a given movement in theoutput gap achieves less inflation stabilization when is small. By the policy rule, the nominal 20Quantitatively, both channels are about equally important.30Figure 5: Impulse responses to the same positive ut shock with u 0.5 and unit size in FIP model crossesand HOP model circles. Monetary policy follows the same rule it f t fxxt in both models.interest rate thus varies more. By the Euler equation, the output gap varies more. With u 0,reducing still decreases the term in square brackets even though expectations interfere with thedirect effect. Overall, when shocks are autocorrelated, a flatter slope increases the equilibriumvariation in inflation and the output gap even more.A compact way to summarize the quantitative differences between both models is throughthe standard deviation u of the residual of the costpush shock. Dynamics coincide acrossmodels if u in the FIP model is set to 95.88 percent of its value in the HOP model.21 Changingthe AR coefficient of the shock alters this factor; u 0.8 implies a factor of 91.21 percent, andu 0 implies a factor of 98.01 percent. Overall, quantitative differences are small.21Proportionality of impulseresponse functions IRFs fails when the model contains endogenous states or whenthere are shocks to the natural real rate. However, differences between IRFs remain moderate in these cases, too.312468102.521.510.50output gap 246810024684inflation 24681002468104nominal rate 24681002464real rate7.3 Monetary Stabilization Policy I turn now to the effect of a flatter slope of the Phillips curve on optimal stabilization policiesunder centralbank discretion and commitment. Optimal stabilization of costpush shocks ineither model derives from minimizing the loss function 18 subject to the NKPC t Ett1xt ut, conditional on the shock process and initial conditions. A discretionary central bankcannot credibly commit to future action such that the optimal targeting rule under discretionis contemporaneous,t xt 0 .Parameter 0 denotes the relative weight on stabilizing the output gap rather than inflationin the loss function. The central bank affects privatesector expectations in case it crediblycommits to future action. Accordingly, the optimal targeting rule under commitment is historydependent,t xt xt 1 0 .In general, optimal targeting rules differ across the FIP and the HOP model because differsacross models.There is one important exception for equal to the welfarebased weight that isarguably the most relevant case. In this case, optimal targeting rules aret 1xt 0 ,t 1xt xt 1 0 .Differences across models that arise under these policies originate exclusively from differencesin the slope of the NKPC and therefore from shock transmission.Figure 6 plots responses in the FIP model crosses and the HOP model circles for optimalpolicy under commitment to a costpush shock with u 0. The weight on stabilizing theoutput gap is the welfarebased weight. In both models, deflation is optimal in the periods afterthe shock. Deflation prevents large increases in optimal prices P cid:63tn,t because firms anticipatethe deflation. Through product demand, large increases in the optimal price would induce theoutput gap to fall by more than what the figure shows.Quantitatively, stabilization is more successful in the HOP model than in the FIP model 32Figure 6: Impulse responses in the FIP model crosses and the HOP model circles for optimal policy undercommitment to a costpush shock ut with u 0.because the slope of the NKPC is steeper in the HOP model. The mechanics are the same asthose underlying Figure 5. Inspecting Figure 6 more carefully reveals that responses die out lessquickly in the FIP model. To illustrate the reason, I iterate the policy rule backward and assumethat inflation and output gap are in steady state before the shock to obtain 1xt t t 1 1 ,t 2 .In equilibrium, current and past inflation rates are related to the output gap simply becausepolicy is historydependent. History dependence projects accumulated past responses into current responses and, thereby, transforms less stabilization into more persistent dynamics. Figure 6 reveals that the magnitude of this effect is fairly small. Ascari and Ropele 2007 find largeeffects of positive longrun inflation on the persistence of responses as proxied by the magnitude 332468102.521.510.50output gap 246810101234inflation 2468100123454nominal rate 24681002464real rateFigure 7: Efficiency frontiers in FIP model thick lines and HOP model thin lines under discretion andcommitment for ut shock with u 0 and u 1.

Presumably, one reason for this is that the functional form of the optimalpolicy rule under commitment in their model changes when longrun inflation is positive ratherthan zero.The finding that stabilization is more successful in the HOP model than in the FIP modelis very general. Figure 7 plots efficiency frontiers for optimal policy under commitment anddiscretion in the FIP model thick lines and the HOP model thin lines. A circle indicates thevariances in inflation and the output gap associated with the optimal policy under the welfarebased loss with . Varying traces out the frontier. Large values of imply a smallvariance in the output gap and a large variance in inflation because the central bank cares mostabout stabilizing the output gap.342040608000.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.9VxVCommitment FIP model HOP model 2040608000.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.9VxVDiscretion FIP model HOP modelStabilization in the HOP model is more successful than in the FIP model because the efficiency frontier of the HOP model is closer to the origin for all values of . The frontiers in the FIP and the HOP model diverge for small values of . The reason for this is that, whenever thecentral bank aims to stabilize inflation, it can do so only by moving the output gap. Accordingly,differences in the slope of the NKPC matter most when the central bank puts a large weight onstable inflation. Frontiers converge to each other for large values of because the central bankdoes not even attempt to stabilize inflation anymore. Accordingly, different slopes of the NKPCno longer matter.To quantify the losses associated with the flatter NKPC in the FIP model, I compute thepercentage difference between losses as LF IP LHOP LHOP for equal to the welfarebasedweight. For discretionary policy, the loss in the FIP model is 6.159 percent larger than the lossin the HOP model. For committed policy, the same quantity is equal to 6.157 percent. Relativewelfare losses associated with a flatter NKPC are nonnegligible. However, there is not much amonetary policymaker can do to reduce losses in the FIP model because policies are alreadyoptimal.8 Conclusion In micro data, it appears that firms move systematically within the productivity distribution.In particular, firms tend to have belowaverage productivity upon entry, and firms tend toexperience postentry growth in productivity. The purpose of this paper is to highlight the consequences of firmlevel productivity dynamics for optimal longrun inflation and for monetarystabilization policy. I work with a New Keynesian model and add two assumptions to capturefirms productivity dynamics. The first assumption is that a firms productivity grows mechanically with the age of the firm. The second assumption is that firm turnover is positive. Jointly,these assumptions make firms heterogenous in terms of productivity. The model nests the basic New Keynesian model with homogenous productivity as a special case.The model delivers two main results. First, optimal longrun inflation is positive and equal togrowth in firmspecific productivity. This result differs markedly from the pricestability resulttypically obtained with models of the New Neoclassical Synthesis. Positive longrun inflation isoptimal because, by growth in firmspecific productivity, the desired real price of a firm declinesover time. Thus, positive optimal inflation erodes sticky nominal prices at exactly the right pace 35to reduce elevated markups and excess dispersion in relative prices. Apparently, many centralbanks around the globe pursue moderately positive rather than zero longrun inflation. Themodel used here suggests this is close to optimal.The second result is that, when linearized at positive longrun inflation, the model withfirmspecific productivity is observationally equivalent to the nested New Keynesian model withhomogenous productivity linearized at zero longrun inflation. This result has several consequences that differ from results reported in the literature. For one, the Taylor principle stillguarantees determinacy in the model with positive longrun inflation. Moreover, the dynamicsof realworld inflation, which is positive on average, are frequently interpreted through the lensesof the basic New Keynesian model linearized at zero longrun inflation, and this interpretationhas been criticized. However, the equivalence result obtained here supports this interpretation.A tightly related result is that both linearized models prescribe the same optimal stabilizationpolicies because the welfarebased loss function of the central bank, derived as a secondorderexpansion to the utility of the representative household, is also the same in both models. Accordingly, my model suggests that optimal stabilization policies, which hold in the basic New Keynesian model near zero longrun inflation, are robust to moderately positive longrun inflation. The related literature argues for the contrary.Overall, these results suggest that firms productivity dynamics observed in micro data matter substantially for conclusions about monetary policy. In the wake of the recent financialturmoil, Williams 2009, Blanchard, Dell Ariccia, and Mauro 2010, and Mc Callum 2010,among others, debate consequences of raising inflation targets to above their current levels inorder to provide central banks with more leeway to cope with large adverse shocks. My results contribute to this debate that firmlevel productivity dynamics call for moderately positivelongrun inflation even without taking into account the zero lower bound on nominal interestrates.It is interesting to extend the current analysis in future work. First, while this paper findspositive optimal longrun inflation in a cashless economy, the literature emphasizes that theopportunity costs arising from holding money imply negative optimal longrun inflation. Future work could assess the relative importance of firmlevel productivity dynamics versus theopportunity costs from holding money for optimal longrun inflation. Second, in line with theevidence, my model emphasizes firmlevel productivity differentials and firmlevel productivitygrowth. Recently, Foster, Haltiwanger, and Syverson 2008 have suggested that demand factors 36are another important distinction across firms. Future work thus might examine models thatalso account for demand factors. Finally, it would be interesting to extend the current analysis tomodels with endogenous firm growth and endogenous firm turnover, and this might require resorting to numerical methods. These extensions would likely make estimates of optimal longruninflation more reliable quantitatively.References Altig, D., L. Christiano, M. Eichenbaum, and J.

A questionthat is debated much in the literature is how this macro estimate of the mean duration of aprice spell compares to micro evidence on the same quantity. Generally, macro data imply alow estimate that implies a long mean duration of price spells. A long mean duration of pricespells is often considered to conflict with micro evidence. Micro evidence indicates a short meanduration of price spells Klenow and Malin 2010, Nakamura and Steinsson 2008.To connect micro and macro evidence, denote the estimate of the slope of the NKPC obtainedfrom macro data as . The mean duration of a price spell, which is derived from the censoreddistribution of price spells, is equal to 11 .23 I relate both by solving the slope 11 sc1for conditional on . Denote the solution as cid:99 with cid:9912 a 02 cid:112a 204 1 anda 0 1 sc1. Of the two solutions cid:9912, I chose the one within the unitinterval. The value of consistent with a particular estimate is then cid:991 . The higher is the lower the value of that is required to match . The macro estimate of the meanduration of a price spell consistent with is then 11 .Figure 8 shows that values of g above unity reduce the mean duration of price spells impliedby a particular slope estimate . Here, is computed based on structural parameters underlyingthe FIP model. I discuss in the main text that the slope not its estimate falls when g increases. To offset the tendency of to fall with , a lower probability for the average priceto remain constant is required. As a result, the mean duration of prices falls. With annualized gequal to 1.03, the mean duration of price spells implied by macro estimates is below 4 quartersin the FIP model rather than right above 4.3 quarters as in the HOP model. Accordingly, the FIP model mitigates the conflict between micro and macro evidence on price stickiness.22Linde 2005 estimates the NKPC in a smallscale model similar to the one considered here. More recently,Cogley and Sbordone 2008 and Cogley, Primiceri, and Sargent 2010 have derived respective estimates.23I consider the censored distribution of prices to isolate the effect of g from the effect of . It is a matter ofcalibration whether one takes into account forced item substitutions or not in order to infer the mean durationof a price spell.44Figure 8: Mean duration of a price spell in quarters in the truncated price distribution as a function of g.
